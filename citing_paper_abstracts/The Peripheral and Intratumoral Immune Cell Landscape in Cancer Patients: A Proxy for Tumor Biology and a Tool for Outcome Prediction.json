        "title": "The Peripheral and Intratumoral Immune Cell Landscape in Cancer Patients: A Proxy for Tumor Biology and a Tool for Outcome Prediction",
        "abstract": "Functional systemic and local immunity is required for effective anti-tumor responses. In addition to an active engagement with cancer cells and tumor stroma, immune cells can be affected and are often found to be dysregulated in cancer patients. The impact of tumors on local and systemic immunity can be assessed using a variety of approaches ranging from low-dimensional analyses that are performed on large patient cohorts to multi-dimensional assays that are technically and logistically challenging and are therefore confined to a limited sample size. Many of these strategies have been established in recent years leading to exciting findings. Not only were analyses of immune cells in tumor patients able to predict the clinical course of the disease and patients\u2019 survival, numerous studies also detected changes in the immune landscape that correlated with responses to novel immunotherapies. This review will provide an overview of established and novel tools for assessing immune cells in tumor patients and will discuss exemplary studies that utilized these techniques to predict patient outcomes."
