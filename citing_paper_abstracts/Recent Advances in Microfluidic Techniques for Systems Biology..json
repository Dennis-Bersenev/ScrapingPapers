        "abstract": "Systems biology seeks to understand complex biological systems using a holistic approach instead of the reductionist approach, which is to study each part of the system individually.1 By examining the differences, interaction, and dynamics between cellular or molecular components, systems biology researchers aim to decipher the complexity of biological systems and to understand the functional networks that form living organisms. Such an understanding has implications in practical applications in many fields, including cancer biology, immunology, microbiology, neuroscience, precision medicine, therapeutic management, and many more.2-3 Thanks to the advances in analytical techniques and high-throughput experimentations, the field of system biology has undergone rapid growth in recent years. With enhanced sensitivity and specificity, a wide spectrum of single-cell and single-molecule analysis techniques, including optical, electrochemical, spectrometric, and sequencing-based methods, enable us to understand the structures and functions of individual biological building blocks.4-5 In order to generate sufficient amount of data to analyze the complexity of biological systems, one needs to integrate analysis techniques with rapid sample handling and perform high-throughput experimentations to collect data, while preserving individual heterogeneities. For the study of certain living biological systems, such as living cells, tissues, or whole organisms, it is often useful to characterize at multiple time-points to probe dynamics of the system in response to perturbations, all in a controlled culturing environment.2, 6."
