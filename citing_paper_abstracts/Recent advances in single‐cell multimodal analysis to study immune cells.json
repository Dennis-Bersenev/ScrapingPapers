        "abstract": "Recent advances in single\u2010cell technologies have enabled the profiling of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome and proteome, along with temporal and spatial information of individual cells. These technologies have provided unique opportunities to understand mechanisms underpinning the immune system, such as characterizations of the molecular cell state, how the cell state evolves along its lineage and the impact of spatial location on cell state. In this review, we discuss how these mechanisms have been studied through recent advances in single\u2010cell multimodal technologies."
