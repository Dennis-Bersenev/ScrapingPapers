        "abstract": "Abstract The development of single-cell RNA-seq has broadened the spectrum for biological research by providing a high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity. However, the requirement for sophisticated devices for the compartmentalization of cells has limited its widespread applicability. Here, we develop Onepot-Seq, a device-free method, that harnesses the transient localization of mRNA after lysis to capture single-cell transcriptomes simultaneously in a continuous fluid medium. In mixed-species experiments, we obtained high-quality single-cell profiles. Further, cell type-specific poly(A)-conjugated antibodies allow Onepot-Seq to effectively capture target cells in complex populations. Chemical perturbations to cells can be profiled by Onepot-Seq at single-cell resolution. Onepot-Seq should allow routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution, accelerating clinical and scientific discoveries in many fields of science."
