        "abstract": "Brain function depends on forming and maintaining connections between neurons of specific types, ensuring neural function while allowing the plasticity necessary for cellular and behavioral dynamics. However, systematic descriptions of how brain cell types organize into synaptic networks and which molecules instruct these relationships are not readily available. Here, we introduce SBARRO (Synaptic Barcode Analysis by Retrograde Rabies ReadOut), a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal directional, monosynaptic relationships based on the paths of a barcoded rabies virus from its \u201cstarter\u201d postsynaptic cell to that cell\u2019s presynaptic partners1. Thousands of these partner relationships can be ascertained in a single experiment, alongside genome-wide RNA profiles \u2013 and thus cell identities and molecular states \u2013 of each host cell. We used SBARRO to describe synaptic networks formed by diverse mouse brain cell types in vitro, leveraging a system similar to those used to identify synaptogenic molecules. We found that the molecular identity (cell type/subtype) of the starter cell predicted the number and types of cells that had synapsed onto it. Rabies transmission tended to occur into cells with RNA-expression signatures related to developmental maturation and synaptic transmission. The estimated size of a cell\u2019s presynaptic network, relative to that of other cells of the same type, associated with increased expression of Arpp21 and Cdh13. By tracking individual virions and their clonal progeny as they travel among host cells, single-cell, single-virion genomic technologies offer new opportunities to map the synaptic organization of neural circuits in health and disease."
