        "title": "Determinants, mechanisms, and functional outcomes of myeloid cell diversity in cancer",
        "abstract": "Most, if not all, aspects of carcinogenesis are influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex architecture of cells, matrix components, soluble signals, and their dynamic interactions in the context of physical traits of the tissue. Expanding application of technologies for high\u2010dimensional analyses with single\u2010cell resolution has begun to decipher the contributions of the immune system to cancer progression and its implications for therapy. In this review, we will discuss the multifaceted roles of tumor\u2010associated macrophages and neutrophils, focusing on factors that subvert tissue immune homeostasis and offer therapeutic opportunities for TME reprogramming. By performing a critical analysis of available datasets, we elaborate on diversification mechanisms and unifying principles of myeloid cell heterogeneity in human tumors."
