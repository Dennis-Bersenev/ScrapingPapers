        "title": "Immature acute leukaemias: lessons from the haematopoietic roadmap",
        "abstract": "It is essential to relate the biology of acute leukaemia to normal blood cell development. In this review, we discuss how modern models of haematopoiesis might inform approaches to diagnosis and management of immature leukaemias, with a specific focus on T\u2010lymphoid and myeloid cases. In particular, we consider whether next\u2010generation analytical tools could provide new perspectives that could improve our understanding of immature blood cancer biology."
