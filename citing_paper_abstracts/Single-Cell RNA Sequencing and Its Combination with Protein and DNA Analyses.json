        "abstract": "Heterogeneity in cell populations poses a significant challenge for understanding complex cell biological processes. The analysis of cells at the single-cell level, especially single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), has made it possible to comprehensively dissect cellular heterogeneity and access unobtainable biological information from bulk analysis. Recent efforts have combined scRNA-seq profiles with genomic or proteomic data, and show added value in describing complex cellular heterogeneity than transcriptome measurements alone. With the rising demand for scRNA-seq for biomedical and clinical applications, there is a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the scRNA-seq technologies and their potential biomedical applications. In this review, we first discuss the latest state of development by detailing each scRNA-seq technology, including both conventional and microfluidic technologies. We then summarize their advantages and limitations along with their biomedical applications. The efforts of integrating the transcriptome profile with highly multiplexed proteomic and genomic data are thoroughly reviewed with results showing the integrated data being more informative than transcriptome data alone. Lastly, the latest progress toward commercialization, the remaining challenges, and future perspectives on the development of scRNA-seq technologies are briefly discussed."
