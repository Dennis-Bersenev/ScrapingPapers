        "title": "Cumulus: a cloud-based data analysis framework for large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq",
        "abstract": "Massively parallel single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) have opened the way to systematic tissue atlases in health and disease, but as the scale of data generation is growing, so does the need for computational pipelines for scaled analysis. Here, we developed Cumulus, a cloud-based framework for analyzing large scale sc/snRNA-seq datasets. Cumulus combines the power of cloud computing with improvements in algorithm implementations to achieve high scalability, low cost, user-friendliness, and integrated support for a comprehensive set of features. We benchmark Cumulus on the Human Cell Atlas Census of Immune Cells dataset of bone marrow cells and show that it substantially improves efficiency over conventional frameworks, while maintaining or improving the quality of results, enabling large-scale studies."
