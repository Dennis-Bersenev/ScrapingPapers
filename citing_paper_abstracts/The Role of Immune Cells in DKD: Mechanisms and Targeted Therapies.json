        "abstract": "Abstract Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), is a common microvascular complication and a major cause of death in patients with diabetes. Disorders of immune cells and immune cytokines can accelerate DKD development of in a number of ways. As the kidney is composed of complex and highly differentiated cells, the interactions among different cell types and immune cells play important regulatory roles in disease development. Here, we summarize the latest research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions among various immune and renal cells in DKD. In addition, we discuss the most recent studies related to single cell technology and bioinformatics analysis in the field of DKD. The aims of our review were to explore immune cells as potential therapeutic targets in DKD and provide some guidance for future clinical treatments."
