        "title": "Single-Cell Analysis of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus",
        "abstract": "With the rapid development of single-cell technologies, the mechanisms underlying viral infections and the interactions between hosts and viruses are starting to be explored at the single-cell level. The foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) causes an acute and persistent infection that can result in the break-out of FMD, which can have serious effects on animal husbandry. Single-cell techniques have emerged as powerful approaches to analyze virus infection at the resolution of individual cells. In this review, the existing single-cell studies examining FMDV will be systematically summarized, and the central themes of these studies will be presented."
