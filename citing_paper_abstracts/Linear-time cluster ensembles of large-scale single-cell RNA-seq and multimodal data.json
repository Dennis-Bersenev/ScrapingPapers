        "abstract": "A fundamental task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis is the identification of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells. Numerous methods have been proposed for this problem, with a recent focus on methods for the cluster analysis of ultra-large scRNA-seq datasets produced by droplet-based sequencing technologies. Most existing methods rely on a sampling step to bridge the gap between algorithm scalability and volume of the data. Ignoring large parts of the data, however, often yields inaccurate groupings of cells and risks overlooking rare cell types. We propose method Specter that adopts and extends recent algorithmic advances in (fast) spectral clustering. In contrast to methods that cluster a (random) subsample of the data, we adopt the idea of landmarks that are used to create a sparse representation of the full data from which a spectral embedding can then be computed in linear time. We exploit Specter\u2019s speed in a cluster ensemble scheme that achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy across 16 scRNA-seq datasets and that is sensitive to rare cell types. Its linear time complexity allows Specter to cluster a dataset comprising 2 million cells in just 26 minutes. Furthermore, on CITE-seq data that simultaneously measures gene and protein marker expression we demonstrate that Specter is able to utilize multimodal omics measurements to resolve subtle transcriptomic differences between subpopulations of cells. Specter is open source and available at https://github.com/canzarlab/Specter."
