        "abstract": "Recent research has found that World Trade Center (WTC) responders in their mid\u201050s have an elevated prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is associated with neural degeneration and subcortical thinning. This article extends our understanding of the molecular complexity of MCI through gene expression profiling of blood."
