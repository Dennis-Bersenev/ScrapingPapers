        "title": "Single-Cell Multiomics Reveals Distinct Cell States at the Top of the Human Hematopoietic Hierarchy",
        "abstract": "The advent of single cell (Sc) genomics has challenged the dogma of haematopoiesis as a tree-like structure of stepwise lineage commitment through distinct and increasingly restricted progenitor populations. Instead, analysis of ScRNA-seq has proposed that the earliest events in human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation are characterized by only subtle molecular changes, with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) existing as a continuum of low-primed cell-states that gradually transition into a specific lineage (CLOUD-HSPCs). Here, we combine ScRNA-seq, ScATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics to dissect the heterogeneity of CLOUD-HSPCs at different stages of human life. Within CLOUD-HSPCs, pseudotime ordering of both mRNA and chromatin data revealed a bifurcation of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lympho/myeloid trajectories immediately downstream a subpopulation with an HSC-specific enhancer signature. Importantly, both HSCs and lineage-restricted progenitor populations could be prospectively isolated based on correlation of their molecular signatures with CD35 and CD11A expression, respectively. Moreover, we describe the changes that occur in this heterogeneity as hematopoiesis develops from neonatal to aged bone marrow, including an increase of HSCs and depletion of lympho-myeloid biased MPPs. Thus, this study dissects the heterogeneity of human CLOUD-HSPCs revealing distinct HSPC-states of relevance in homeostatic settings such as ageing."
