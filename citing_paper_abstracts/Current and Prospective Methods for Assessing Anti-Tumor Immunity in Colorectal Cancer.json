        "title": "Current and Prospective Methods for Assessing Anti-Tumor Immunity in Colorectal Cancer",
        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide despite recent progress in treatment strategies. Though immune checkpoint inhibition has proven effective for a number of other tumors, it offers benefits in only a small group of CRC patients with high microsatellite instability. In general, heterogenous cell groups in the tumor microenvironment are considered as the major barrier for unveiling the causes of low immune response. Therefore, deconvolution of cellular components in highly heterogeneous microenvironments is crucial for understanding the immune contexture of cancer. In this review, we assimilate current knowledge and recent studies examining anti-tumor immunity in CRC. We also discuss the utilization of novel immune contexture assessment methods that have not been used in CRC research to date."
