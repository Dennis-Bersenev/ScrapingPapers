        "title": "Infection Diverse Mucosal-Associated Invariant TCR Usage in HIV",
        "abstract": "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate-like T cells that specifically target bacterial metabolites but are also identified as innate-like sensors of viral infection. Individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection have lower numbers of circulating MAIT cells compared with healthy individuals, yet the features of the MAIT TCR repertoire are not well known. We isolated and stimulated human PBMCs from healthy non-HIV\u2013infected donors (HD), HIV-infected progressors on antiretroviral therapy, and HIV-infected elite controllers (EC). We sorted MAIT cells using flow cytometry and used a high-throughput sequencing method with bar coding to link the expression of TCRa, TCRb, and functional genes of interest at the single-cell level. We show differential patterns of MAIT TCR usage among the groups. We observed expansions of certain dominant MAIT clones in HIV-infected individuals upon Escherichia coli stimulation, which was not observed in clones of HD. We also found different patterns of CDR3 amino acid distributions among the three groups. Furthermore, we found blunted expression of phenotypic genes in HIV individuals; most notably, HD mounted a robust IFNG response to stimulation, whereas both HIV-infected progressors and EC did not. In conclusion, our study describes the diverse MAIT TCR repertoire of persons with chronic HIV-1 infection and suggest that MAIT clones of HIV-infected persons may be primed for expansion more than that of noninfected persons. Further studies are needed to examine the functional significance of unique MAIT cell TCR usage in EC. ImmunoHorizons, 2021, 5: 360\u2013369."
