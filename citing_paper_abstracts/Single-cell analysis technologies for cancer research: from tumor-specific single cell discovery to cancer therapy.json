        "title": "Single-cell analysis technologies for cancer research: from tumor-specific single cell discovery to cancer therapy",
        "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing (SCS) technology is changing our understanding of cellular components, functions, and interactions across organisms, because of its inherent advantage of avoiding noise resulting from genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity across numerous samples. By directly and individually measuring multiple molecular characteristics of thousands to millions of single cells, SCS technology can characterize multiple cell types and uncover the mechanisms of gene regulatory networks, the dynamics of transcription, and the functional state of proteomic profiling. In this context, we conducted systematic research on SCS techniques, including the fundamental concepts, procedural steps, and applications of scDNA, scRNA, scATAC, scCITE, and scSNARE methods, focusing on the unique clinical advantages of SCS, particularly in cancer therapy. We have explored challenging but critical areas such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), lineage tracing, tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and tumor immunotherapy. Despite challenges in managing and analyzing the large amounts of data that result from SCS, this technique is expected to reveal new horizons in cancer research. This review aims to emphasize the key role of SCS in cancer research and promote the application of single-cell technologies to cancer therapy."
