        "title": "Exploiting Molecular Barcodes in High-Throughput Cellular Assays",
        "abstract": "Multiplexing strategies, which greatly increase the number of simultaneously measured parameters in single experiments, are now being widely implemented by both the pharmaceutical industry and academic researchers. Color has long been used to identify biological signals and, when combined with molecular barcodes, has substantially enhanced the depth of multiplexed sample characterization. Moreover, the recent advent of DNA barcodes has led to an explosion of innovative cell sequencing approaches. Novel barcoding strategies also show great promise for encoding spatial information in transcriptomic studies, and for precise assessment of molecular abundance. Both color- and DNA-based barcodes can be conveniently analyzed with either a microscope or a cytometer, or via DNA sequencing. Here we review the basic principles of several technologies used to create barcodes and detail the type of samples that can be identified with such tags."
