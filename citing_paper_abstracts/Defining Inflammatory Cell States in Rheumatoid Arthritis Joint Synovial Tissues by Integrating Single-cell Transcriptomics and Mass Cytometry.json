        "title": "Defining Inflammatory Cell States in Rheumatoid Arthritis Joint Synovial Tissues by Integrating Single-cell Transcriptomics and Mass Cytometry",
        "abstract": "To define the cell populations in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) driving joint inflammation, we applied single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry, bulk RNA-seq, and flow cytometry to sorted T cells, B cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts from 51 synovial tissue RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patient samples. Utilizing an integrated computational strategy based on canonical correlation analysis to 5,452 scRNA-seq profiles, we identified 18 unique cell populations. Combining mass cytometry and transcriptomics together revealed cell states expanded in RA synovia: THY1+HLAhigh sublining fibroblasts (OR=33.8), IL1B+ pro-inflammatory monocytes (OR=7.8), CD11c+T-bet+ autoimmune-associated B cells (OR=5.7), and PD-1+Tph/Tfh (OR=3.0). We also defined CD8+ T cell subsets characterized by GZMK+, GZMB+, and GNLY+ expression. Using bulk and single-cell data, we mapped inflammatory mediators to source cell populations, for example attributing IL6 production to THY1+HLAhigh fibroblasts and na\u00efve B cells, and IL1B to pro-inflammatory monocytes. These populations are potentially key mediators of RA pathogenesis."
