        "title": "UMINT: Unsupervised Neural Network For Single Cell Multi-Omics Integration",
        "abstract": "Multi-omics studies have enabled us to understand the mechanistic drivers behind complex disease states and progressions, thereby providing novel and actionable biological insights into health status. However, integrating data from multiple modalities is challenging due to the high dimensionality of data and noise associated with each platform. Non-overlapping features and technical batch effects in the data make the task of learning more complicated. Conventional machine learning (ML) tools are not quite effective against such data integration hazards. In addition, existing methods for single cell multi-omics integration are computationally expensive. This has encouraged the development of a novel architecture that produces a robust model for integration of high-dimensional multi-omics data, which would be capable of learning meaningful features for further downstream analysis. In this work, we have introduced a novel Unsupervised neural network for single cell Multi-omics INTegration (UMINT). UMINT serves as a promising model for integrating variable number of single cell omics layers with high dimensions, and provides substantial reduction in the number of parameters. It is capable of learning a latent low-dimensional embedding that can capture useful data characteristics. The effectiveness of UMINT has been evaluated on benchmark CITE-seq (paired RNA and surface proteins) datasets. It has outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods for multi-omics integration."
