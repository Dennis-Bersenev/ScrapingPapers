        "title": "Single\u2010cell analysis of CD8 T lymphocyte diversity during adaptive immunity",
        "abstract": "An effective adaptive immune response to microbial infection relies on the generation of heterogeneous T lymphocyte fates and functions. CD8 T lymphocytes play a pivotal role in mediating immediate and long\u2010term protective immune responses to intracellular pathogen infection. Systems\u2010based analysis of the immune response to infection has begun to identify cell fate determinants and the molecular mechanisms underpinning CD8 T lymphocyte diversity at single\u2010cell resolution. Resolving CD8 T lymphocyte heterogeneity during adaptive immunity highlights the advantages of single\u2010cell technologies and computational approaches to better understand the ontogeny of CD8 T cellular diversity following infection. Future directions of integrating single\u2010cell multiplex approaches capitalize on the importance of systems biology in the understanding of immune CD8 T cell differentiation and functional diversity."
