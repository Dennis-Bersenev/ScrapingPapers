        "abstract": "Single-cell technologies allow precise identification of tumor composition at the single-cell level, providing high-resolution insights into the intratumoral heterogeneity and transcriptional activity of cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that previous approaches failed to capture. Malignant gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors in adults, are genetically heterogeneous and their TME consists of various stromal and immune cells playing an important role in tumor progression and responses to therapies. Previous gene expression or immunocytochemical studies of immune cells infiltrating TME of malignant gliomas failed to dissect their functional phenotypes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) are powerful techniques allowing quantification of whole transcriptomes or >30 protein targets in individual cells. Both methods provide unprecedented resolution of TME. We summarize the findings from these studies and the current state of knowledge of a functional diversity of immune infiltrates in malignant gliomas with different genetic alterations. A precise definition of functional phenotypes of myeloid and lymphoid cells might be essential for designing effective immunotherapies. Single-cell omics studies have identified crucial cell subpopulations and signaling pathways that promote tumor progression, influence patient survival or make tumors vulnerable to immunotherapy. We anticipate that the widespread usage of single-cell omics would allow rational design of oncoimmunotherapeutics."
