        "title": "A Single-Cell Sequencing Guide for Immunologists",
        "abstract": "In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the use of single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches in the field of immunology. With the wide range of technologies available, it is becoming harder for users to select the best scRNA-seq protocol/platform to address their biological questions of interest. Here, we compared the advantages and limitations of four commonly used scRNA-seq platforms in order to clarify their suitability for different experimental applications. We also address how the datasets generated by different scRNA-seq platforms can be integrated, and how to identify unknown populations of single cells using unbiased bioinformatics methods."
