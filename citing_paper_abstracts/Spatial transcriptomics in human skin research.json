        "title": "Spatial transcriptomics in human skin research",
        "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics is a revolutionary technique that enables researchers to characterise tissue architecture and localisation of gene expression. A plethora of technologies that map gene expression are currently being developed, aiming to facilitate spatially resolved, high\u2010dimensional assessment of gene transcription in the context of human skin research. Knowing which gene is expressed by which cell and in which location within skin, facilitates understanding of skin function and dysfunction in both health and disease. In this review, we summarise the available spatial transcriptomic methods and we describe their application to a broad spectrum of dermatological diseases."
