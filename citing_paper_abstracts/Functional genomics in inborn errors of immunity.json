        "title": "Functional genomics in inborn errors of immunity",
        "abstract": "Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) comprise a diverse spectrum of 485 disorders as recognized by the International Union of Immunological Societies Committee on Inborn Error of Immunity in 2022. While IEI are monogenic by definition, they illuminate various pathways involved in the pathogenesis of polygenic immune dysregulation as in autoimmune or autoinflammatory syndromes, or in more common infectious diseases that may not have a significant genetic basis. Rapid improvement in genomic technologies has been the main driver of the accelerated rate of discovery of IEI and has led to the development of innovative treatment strategies. In this review, we will explore various facets of IEI, delving into the distinctions between PIDD and PIRD. We will examine how Mendelian inheritance patterns contribute to these disorders and discuss advancements in functional genomics that aid in characterizing new IEI. Additionally, we will explore how emerging genomic tools help to characterize new IEI as well as how they are paving the way for innovative treatment approaches for managing and potentially curing these complex immune conditions."
