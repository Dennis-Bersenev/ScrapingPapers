        "title": "Cobolt: Joint analysis of multimodal single-cell sequencing data",
        "abstract": "A growing number of single-cell sequencing platforms enable joint profiling of multiple omics from the same cells. We present Cobolt, a novel method that not only allows for analyzing the data from joint-modality platforms, but provides a coherent framework for the integration of multiple datasets measured on different modalities. We demonstrate its performance on multi-modality data of gene expression and chromatin accessibility and illustrate the integration abilities of Cobolt by jointly analyzing this multi-modality data with single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets."
