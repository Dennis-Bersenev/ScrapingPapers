        "title": "Application of single-cell omics in inflammatory bowel disease",
        "abstract": "Over the past decade, the advent of single cell RNA-sequencing has revolutionized the approach in cellular transcriptomics research. The current technology offers an unbiased platform to understand how genotype correlates to phenotype. Single-cell omics applications in gastrointestinal (GI) research namely inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become popular in the last few years with multiple publications as single-cell omics techniques can be applied directly to the target organ, the GI tract at the tissue level. Through examination of mucosal tissue and peripheral blood in IBD, the recent boom in single cell research has identified a myriad of key immune players from enterocytes to tissue resident memory T cells, and explored functional heterogeneity within cellular subsets previously unreported. As we begin to unravel the complex mucosal immune system in states of health and disease like IBD, the power of exploration through single-cell omics can change our approach to translational research. As novel techniques evolve through multiplexing single-cell omics and spatial transcriptomics come to the forefront, we can begin to fully comprehend the disease IBD and better design targets of treatment. In addition, hopefully these techniques can ultimately begin to identify biomarkers of therapeutic response and answer clinically relevant questions in how to tailor individual therapy to patients through personalized medicine."
