        "title": "Clustering CITE-seq data with a canonical correlation-based deep learning method",
        "abstract": "Single-cell multiomics sequencing techniques have rapidly developed in the past few years. Among these techniques, single-cell cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of gene expression and surface proteins. Clustering CITE-seq data have the great potential of providing us with a more comprehensive and in-depth view of cell states and interactions. However, CITE-seq data inherit the properties of scRNA-seq data, being noisy, large-dimensional, and highly sparse. Moreover, representations of RNA and surface protein are sometimes with low correlation and contribute divergently to the clustering object. To overcome these obstacles and find a combined representation well suited for clustering, we proposed scCTClust for multiomics data, especially CITE-seq data, and clustering analysis. Two omics-specific neural networks are introduced to extract cluster information from omics data. A deep canonical correlation method is adopted to find the maximumly correlated representations of two omics. A novel decentralized clustering method is utilized over the linear combination of latent representations of two omics. The fusion weights which can account for contributions of omics to clustering are adaptively updated during training. Extensive experiments over both simulated and real CITE-seq data sets demonstrated the power of scCTClust. We also applied scCTClust on transcriptome\u2013epigenome data to illustrate its potential for generalizing."
