        "abstract": "A central question in immunology is what features allow the immune system to respond in a timely manner to a variety of pathogens encountered at unanticipated times and diverse body sites. Two decades of advanced and static dynamic imaging methods have now revealed several major principles facilitating host defense. Suborgan spatial prepositioning of distinct cells promotes time\u2010efficient interactions upon pathogen sensing. Such pre\u2010organization also provides an effective barrier to movement of pathogens from parenchymal tissues into the blood circulation. Various molecular mechanisms maintain effective intercellular communication among otherwise rapidly moving cells. These and related discoveries have benefited from recent increases in the number of parameters that can be measured simultaneously in a single tissue section and the extension of such multiplex analyses to 3D tissue volumes. The application of new computational methods to such imaging data has provided a quantitative, in vivo context for cell trafficking and signaling pathways traditionally explored in vitro or with dissociated cell preparations. Here, we summarize our efforts to devise and employ diverse imaging tools to probe immune system organization and function, concluding with a commentary on future developments, which we believe will reveal even more about how the immune system operates in health and disease."
