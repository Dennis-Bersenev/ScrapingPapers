        "title": "Advances in single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology and its application in hematopoietic system research",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of single cell sequencing technology, which could reveal the mystery of the heterogeneity of cell populations. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology offers us an alternative method to classify or characterize cells at the molecular level, which enables its broad application in various fields of research, such as developmental biology, neuroscience, hematology, immunity and cancer. In this paper, we will review the main development and trends of latest single cell transcriptome sequencing technology, and its applications in hematopoietic system is presented."
