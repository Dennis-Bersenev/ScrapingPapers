        "title": "The ResolveOME Platform for Comprehensive Analysis of Multi-omic Layers of Single-cell Biology",
        "abstract": "The central dogma of molecular biology states that the genome of every single cell contains the complete set of instructions for all biological life. The omic layers, comprised of the entire genome, transcriptome and proteome, synchronize to translate and decode this genetic code to dictate cellular fate. Normal and pathologic cellular development are dependent on the fidelity of this transformative process. They are dependent on the OME, or the sum of ALL of the parts."
