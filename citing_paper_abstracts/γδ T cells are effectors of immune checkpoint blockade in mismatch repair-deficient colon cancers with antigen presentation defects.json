        "abstract": "DNA mismatch repair deficient (MMR-d) cancers present an abundance of neoantigens that likely underlies their exceptional responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)1,2. However, MMR-d colon cancers that evade CD8+ T cells through loss of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I-mediated antigen presentation3\u20136, frequently remain responsive to ICB7 suggesting the involvement of other immune effector cells. Here, we demonstrate that HLA class I-negative MMR-d cancers are highly infiltrated by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. These \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are mainly composed of V\u03b41 and V\u03b43 subsets, and express high levels of PD-1, activation markers including cytotoxic molecules, and a broad repertoire of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). In vitro, PD-1+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, isolated from MMR-d colon cancers, exhibited a cytolytic response towards HLA class I-negative MMR-d colon cancer cell lines and \u03b22-microglobulin (B2M)-knockout patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs), which was enhanced as compared to antigen presentation-proficient cells. This response was diminished after blocking the interaction between NKG2D and its ligands. By comparing paired tumor samples of MMR-d colorectal cancer patients obtained before and after dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade, we found that ICB profoundly increased the intratumoral frequency of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in HLA class I-negative cancers. Taken together, these data indicate that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells contribute to the response to ICB therapy in patients with HLA class I-negative, MMR-d colon cancers, and illustrate the potential of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in cancer immunotherapy."
