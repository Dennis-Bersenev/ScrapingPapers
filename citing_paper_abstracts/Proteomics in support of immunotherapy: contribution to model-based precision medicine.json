        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Proteomics encompasses a wide and expanding range of methods to identify, characterize, and quantify thousands of proteins from a variety of biological samples, including blood samples, tumors, and tissues. Such methods are supportive of various forms of immunotherapy applied to chronic conditions such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and infectious diseases. Areas covered In support of immunotherapy, proteomics based on mass spectrometry has multiple specific applications related to (i) disease modeling and patient stratification, (ii) antigen/ autoantigen/neoantigen/ allergen identification, (iii) characterization of proteins and monoclonal antibodies used for immunotherapeutic or diagnostic purposes, (iv) identification of biomarkers and companion diagnostics and (v) monitoring by immunoproteomics of immune responses elicited in the course of the disease or following immunotherapy. Expert opinion Proteomics contributes as an enabling technology to an evolution of immunotherapy toward a precision medicine approach aiming to better tailor treatments to patients\u2019 specificities in multiple disease areas. This trend is favored by a better understanding through multi-omics profiling of both the patient\u2019s characteristics, his/her immune status as well as of the features of the immunotherapeutic drug."
