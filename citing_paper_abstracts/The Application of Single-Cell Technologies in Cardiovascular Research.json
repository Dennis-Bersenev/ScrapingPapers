        "title": "The Application of Single-Cell Technologies in Cardiovascular Research",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of deaths in the world. The intricacies of the cellular composition and tissue microenvironment in heart and vasculature complicate the dissection of molecular mechanisms of CVDs. Over the past decade, the rapid development of single-cell omics technologies generated vast quantities of information at various biological levels, which have shed light on the cellular and molecular dynamics in cardiovascular development, homeostasis and diseases. Here, we summarize the latest single-cell omics techniques, and show how they have facilitated our understanding of cardiovascular biology. We also briefly discuss the clinical value and future outlook of single-cell applications in the field."
