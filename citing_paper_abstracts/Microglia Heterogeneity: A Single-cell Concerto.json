        "title": "Microglia Heterogeneity: A Single-cell Concerto",
        "abstract": "Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that play crucial roles in development, homeostasis, and response to perturbation. Microglia react to the surrounding environment in a context-dependent manner. However, research on microglial heterogeneity is limited, given the lack of high-resolution and high-sensitivity methods. Recent studies have demonstrated the heterogeneity of microglia on a spatial-temporal scale, benefiting from the advancement of single-cell technologies. Here, we review the current knowledge about microglial diversity during physiological and pathological conditions in humans and mice."
