        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of multifactorial origin. Extensive research is ongoing to better understand, prevent, and treat progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma. While experimental models of glaucoma and postmortem tissues of human donors are analyzed for pathophysiological comprehension and improved treatment of this blinding disease, clinical samples of intraocular biofluids and blood collected from glaucoma patients are analyzed to identify predictive, diagnostic, and prognostic biomarkers. Multiplexing techniques for protein analysis offer a valuable approach for translational glaucoma research. Areas covered This review provides an overview of the increasing applications of multiplex protein analysis for glaucoma research and also highlights current research challenges in the field and expected solutions from emerging technological advances. Expert opinion Analytical techniques for multiplex analysis of proteins can help uncover neurodegenerative processes for enhanced treatment of glaucoma and can help identify molecular biomarkers for improved clinical testing and monitoring of this complex disease. This evolving field and continuously growing availability of new technologies are expected to broaden the comprehension of this complex neurodegenerative disease and speed up the progress toward new therapeutics and personalized patient care to prevent blindness from glaucoma."
