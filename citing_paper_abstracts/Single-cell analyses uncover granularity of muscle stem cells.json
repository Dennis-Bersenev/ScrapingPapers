        "title": "Single-cell analyses uncover granularity of muscle stem cells",
        "abstract": "Satellite cells are the main muscle-resident cells responsible for muscle regeneration. Much research has described this population as being heterogeneous, but little is known about the different roles each subpopulation plays. Recent advances in the field have utilized the power of single-cell analysis to better describe and functionally characterize subpopulations of satellite cells as well as other cell groups comprising the muscle tissue. Furthermore, emerging technologies are opening the door to answering as-yet-unresolved questions pertaining to satellite cell heterogeneity and cell fate decisions."
