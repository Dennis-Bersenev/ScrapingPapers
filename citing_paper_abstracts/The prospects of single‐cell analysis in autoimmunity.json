        "title": "The prospects of single\u2010cell analysis in autoimmunity",
        "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been a tremendous development of technologies focused on analysing various molecular attributes in single cells, with an ever\u2010increasing number of parameters becoming available at the DNA, RNA and protein levels. Much of this progress has involved cells in suspension, but also in situ analysis of tissues has taken great leaps. Paralleling the development in the laboratory, and because of increasing complexity, the analysis of single\u2010cell data is also constantly being updated with new algorithms and analysis platforms. Our immune system shares this complexity, and immunologists have therefore been in the forefront of this technological development. These technologies clearly open new avenues for immunology research, maybe particularly within autoimmunity where the interaction between the faulty immune system and the thymus or the target organ is important. However, the technologies currently available can seem overwhelming and daunting. The aim of this review is to remedy this by giving a balanced overview of the prospects of using single\u2010cell analysis in basal and clinical autoimmunity research, with an emphasis on endocrine autoimmunity."
