        "title": "Implications of tumour heterogeneity on cancer evolution and therapy resistance: lessons from breast cancer",
        "abstract": "Tumour heterogeneity is pervasive amongst many cancers and leads to disease progression, and therapy resistance. In this review, using breast cancer as an exemplar, we focus on the recent advances in understanding the interplay between tumour cells and their microenvironment using single cell sequencing and digital spatial profiling technologies. Further, we discuss the utility of lineage tracing methodologies in pre\u2010clinical models of breast cancer, and how these are being used to unravel new therapeutic vulnerabilities and reveal biomarkers of breast cancer progression. \u00a9 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."
