        "abstract": "Abstract The single-cell proteomics enables the direct quantification of protein abundance at the single-cell resolution, providing valuable insights into cellular phenotypes beyond what can be inferred from transcriptome analysis alone. However, insufficient large-scale integrated databases hinder researchers from accessing and exploring single-cell proteomics, impeding the advancement of this field. To fill this deficiency, we present a comprehensive database, namely Single-cell Proteomic DataBase (SPDB, https://scproteomicsdb.com/), for general single-cell proteomic data, including antibody-based or mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics. Equipped with standardized data process and a user-friendly web interface, SPDB provides unified data formats for convenient interaction with downstream analysis, and offers not only dataset-level but also protein-level data search and exploration capabilities. To enable detailed exhibition of single-cell proteomic data, SPDB also provides a module for visualizing data from the perspectives of cell metadata or protein features. The current version of SPDB encompasses 133 antibody-based single-cell proteomic datasets involving more than 300 million cells and over 800 marker/surface proteins, and 10 mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomic datasets involving more than 4000 cells and over 7000 proteins. Overall, SPDB is envisioned to be explored as a useful resource that will facilitate the wider research communities by providing detailed insights into proteomics from the single-cell perspective."
