        "abstract": "Significance Alterations in miR-15/16 can lead to hematological malignancies. Loss of a single cluster occurs frequently in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but unexpectedly, loss of both clusters in mice promotes a myeloproliferative disorder resembling acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that the complete absence of miR-15/16 in multipotent progenitors (MPPs) results in expanded numbers and altered functions of this subpopulation of hematopoietic cells, contributing to myeloid-skewing and a hyperproliferative state. Since a molecular signature of miR-15/16 deletion in murine MPPs correlates with poor outcome in AML patients, our findings appear important for leukemia biology and as a potentially valuable biomarker in blood cancers. This study demonstrates that miR-15/16 plays an important role at the apex of hematopoiesis."
