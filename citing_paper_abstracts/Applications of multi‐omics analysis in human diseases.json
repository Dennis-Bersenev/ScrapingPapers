        "title": "Applications of multi\u2010omics analysis in human diseases",
        "abstract": "Abstract Multi\u2010omics usually refers to the crossover application of multiple high\u2010throughput screening technologies represented by genomics, transcriptomics, single\u2010cell transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics, and so on, which play a great role in promoting the study of human diseases. Most of the current reviews focus on describing the development of multi\u2010omics technologies, data integration, and application to a particular disease; however, few of them provide a comprehensive and systematic introduction of multi\u2010omics. This review outlines the existing technical categories of multi\u2010omics, cautions for experimental design, focuses on the integrated analysis methods of multi\u2010omics, especially the approach of machine learning and deep learning in multi\u2010omics data integration and the corresponding tools, and the application of multi\u2010omics in medical researches (e.g., cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, aging, and drug target discovery) as well as the corresponding open\u2010source analysis tools and databases, and finally, discusses the challenges and future directions of multi\u2010omics integration and application in precision medicine. With the development of high\u2010throughput technologies and data integration algorithms, as important directions of multi\u2010omics for future disease research, single\u2010cell multi\u2010omics and spatial multi\u2010omics also provided a detailed introduction. This review will provide important guidance for researchers, especially who are just entering into multi\u2010omics medical research."
