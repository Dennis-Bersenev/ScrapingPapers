        "abstract": "Abstract Carcinomas are complex heterocellular systems containing epithelial cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts, and multiple immune cell\u2010types. Cell\u2010cell communication between these tumor microenvironments (TME) and cells drives cancer progression and influences response to existing therapies. In order to provide better treatments for patients, we must understand how various cell\u2010types collaborate within the TME to drive cancer and consider the multiple signals present between and within different cancer types. To investigate how tissues function, we need a model to measure both how signals are transferred between cells and how that information is processed within cells. The interplay of collaboration between different cell\u2010types requires cell\u2010cell communication. This article aims to review the current in vitro and in vivo mono\u2010cellular and multi\u2010cellular cultures models of colorectal cancer (CRC), and to explore how they can be used for single\u2010cell multi\u2010omics approaches for isolating multiple types of molecules from a single\u2010cell required for cell\u2010cell communication to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. Integrating the existing single\u2010cell signaling measurements and models, and through understanding the cell identity and how different cell types communicate, will help predict drug sensitivities in tumor cells and between\u2010 and within\u2010patients responses."
