        "title": "Glycan Profiling by Sequencing to Uncover Multicellular Communication: Launching Glycobiology in Single Cells and Microbiomes",
        "abstract": "Glycans are essential building blocks of life that are located at the outermost surface of all cells from mammals to bacteria and even viruses. Cell surface glycans mediate multicellular communication in diverse biological processes and are useful as \u201csurface markers\u201d to identify cells. Various single-cell sequencing technologies have already emerged that enable the high-throughput analysis of omics information, such as transcriptome and genome profiling on a cell-by-cell basis, which has advanced our understanding of complex multicellular interactions. However, there has been no robust technology to analyze the glycome in single cells, mainly because glycans with branched and heterogeneous structures cannot be readily amplified by polymerase chain reactions like nucleic acids. We hypothesized that the generation of lectins conjugated with DNA barcodes (DNA-barcoded lectins) would enable the conversion of glycan information to gene information, which may be amplified and measured using DNA sequencers. This technology will enable the simultaneous analysis of glycan and RNA in single cells. Based on this concept, we developed a technology to analyze glycans and RNA in single cells, which was referred to as scGR-seq. Using scGR-seq, we acquired glycan and gene expression profiles of individual cells constituting heterogeneous cell populations, such as tissues. We further extended Glycan-seq to the profiling of the surface glycans of bacteria and even gut microbiota. Glycan-seq and scGR-seq are new technologies that enable us to elucidate the function of glycans in cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013microorganism communication, which extends glycobiology to the level of single cells and microbiomes."
