        "title": "Spatial transcriptomics technology in cancer research",
        "abstract": "In recent years, spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have developed rapidly and have been widely used in constructing spatial tissue atlases and characterizing spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cancers. Currently, ST has been used to profile spatial heterogeneity in multiple cancer types. Besides, ST is a benefit for identifying and comprehensively understanding special spatial areas such as tumor interface and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which exhibit unique tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Therefore, ST has also shown great potential to improve pathological diagnosis and identify novel prognostic factors in cancer. This review presents recent advances and prospects of applications on cancer research based on ST technologies as well as the challenges."
