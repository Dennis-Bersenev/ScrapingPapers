        "title": "Aged Breast Extracellular Matrix Drives Mammary Epithelial Cells to an Invasive and Cancer\u2010Like Phenotype",
        "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for cancer. While the importance of age related genetic alterations in cells on cancer progression is well documented, the effect of aging extracellular matrix (ECM) has been overlooked. Here, we show for the first time that the aging breast ECM is sufficient to drive normal mammary epithelial cells (KTB21) to a more invasive and cancer-like phenotype, while promoting motility and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells. E-cadherin membrane localization was lost in KTB21 cells cultured on the decellularized breast matrix from aged mice. Cell motility, cell invasion, and inflammatory cytokine and cancer-related protein production were increased significantly on the aged matrix, and many genes related to invasion were upregulated. Strikingly, we showed using single cell RNA sequencing that the aged matrix led to enrichment of a subpopulation of KTB21 cells that highly expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion-related genes. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) knockdown reverted the aged matrix-induced changes to the young levels; LOX siRNA treatment prevented the loss of E-cadherin membrane localization, and reduced cell motility, cell invasion, and cytokine and cancer-related protein production. Finally, we showed that the biophysical, mechanical and biochemical properties of the breast ECM were altered dramatically upon aging. Analyzing these factors and studying the differential response of the epithelial cells to young and aged ECMs could lead to identification of new targets for cancer treatment and could pave the way for the discovery of new therapeutic options."
