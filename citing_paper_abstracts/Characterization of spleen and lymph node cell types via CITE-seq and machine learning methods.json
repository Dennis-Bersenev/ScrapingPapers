        "title": "Characterization of spleen and lymph node cell types via CITE-seq and machine learning methods",
        "abstract": "The spleen and lymph nodes are important functional organs for human immune system. The identification of cell types for spleen and lymph nodes is helpful for understanding the mechanism of immune system. However, the cell types of spleen and lymph are highly diverse in the human body. Therefore, in this study, we employed a series of machine learning algorithms to computationally analyze the cell types of spleen and lymph based on single-cell CITE-seq sequencing data. A total of 28,211 cell data (training vs. test = 14,435 vs. 13,776) involving 24 cell types were collected for this study. For the training dataset, it was analyzed by Boruta and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) one by one, resulting in an mRMR feature list. This list was fed into the incremental feature selection (IFS) method, incorporating four classification algorithms (deep forest, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and decision tree). Some essential features were discovered and the deep forest with its optimal features achieved the best performance. A group of related proteins (CD4, TCRb, CD103, CD43, and CD23) and genes (Nkg7 and Thy1) contributing to the classification of spleen and lymph nodes cell types were analyzed. Furthermore, the classification rules yielded by decision tree were also provided and analyzed. Above findings may provide helpful information for deepening our understanding on the diversity of cell types."
