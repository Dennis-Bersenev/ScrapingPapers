        "title": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like tumor cells remodel the Ewing sarcoma tumor microenvironment",
        "abstract": "Tumor heterogeneity is a major driver of cancer progression. In epithelial-derived malignancies, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to tumor heterogeneity by depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that dynamically remodel the tumor microenvironment (TME). Ewing sarcomas (EwS) are histologically monomorphous, mesenchyme-derived tumors that are devoid of CAFs. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized subpopulation of transcriptionally distinct EwS tumor cells that deposit pro-tumorigenic ECM. Single cell analyses revealed that these CAF-like cells differ from bulk EwS cells by their upregulation of a matrisome-rich gene signature that is normally repressed by EWS::FLI1, the oncogenic fusion transcription factor that underlies EwS pathogenesis. Further, our studies showed that ECM-depositing tumor cells express the cell surface marker CD73, allowing for their isolation ex vivo and detection in situ. Spatial profiling of tumor xenografts and patient biopsies demonstrated that CD73+ EwS cells and tumor cell-derived ECM are prevalent along tumor borders and invasive fronts. Importantly, despite loss of EWS::FLI1-mediated gene repression, CD73+ EwS cells retain expression of EWS::FLI1 and the fusion-activated gene signature, as well as tumorigenic and proliferative capacities. Thus, EwS tumor cells can be reprogrammed to adopt CAF-like properties and these transcriptionally and phenotypically distinct cell subpopulations contribute to tumor heterogeneity by remodeling the TME."
