        "abstract": "Rapid technological progress in the recent years has allowed the high-throughput interrogation of different types of biomolecules from single cells. Combining several of these readouts into integrated multi-omic assays is essential to comprehensively understand and model cellular processes. Here, we report the development of Expanded CRISPR-compatible Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq) for the high-throughput characterization of at least five modalities of information from each single cell: transcriptome, immune receptor clonotypes, surface markers, sample identity and sgRNAs. We demonstrate the use of ECCITE-seq to directly and efficiently capture sgRNA molecules and measure their effects on gene expression and protein levels, opening the possibility of performing high throughput single cell CRISPR screens with multimodal readout using existing libraries and commonly used vectors. Finally, by utilizing the combined phenotyping of clonotype and cell surface markers in immune cells, we apply ECCITE to study a lymphoma sample to discriminate cells and define molecular signatures of malignant cells within a heterogeneous population."
