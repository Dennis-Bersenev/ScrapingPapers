        "title": "Efficient Generation of Paired Single\u2010Cell Multiomics Profiles by Deep Learning",
        "abstract": "Recent advances in single\u2010cell sequencing technology have made it possible to measure multiple paired omics simultaneously in a single cell such as cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE\u2010seq) and single\u2010nucleus chromatin accessibility and mRNA expression sequencing (SNARE\u2010seq). However, the widespread application of these single\u2010cell multiomics profiling technologies has been limited by their experimental complexity, noise in nature, and high cost. In addition, single\u2010omics sequencing technologies have generated tremendous and high\u2010quality single\u2010cell datasets but have yet to be fully utilized. Here, single\u2010cell multiomics generation (scMOG), a deep learning\u2010based framework to generate single\u2010cell assay for transposase\u2010accessible chromatin (ATAC) data in silico is developed from experimentally available single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq measurements and vice versa. The results demonstrate that scMOG can accurately perform cross\u2010omics generation between RNA and ATAC, and generate paired multiomics data with biological meanings when one omics is experimentally unavailable and out of training datasets. The generated ATAC, either alone or in combination with measured RNA, exhibits equivalent or superior performance to that of the experimentally measured counterparts throughout multiple downstream analyses. scMOG is also applied to human lymphoma data, which proves to be more effective in identifying tumor samples than the experimentally measured ATAC data. Finally, the performance of scMOG is investigated in other omics such as proteomics and it still shows robust performance on surface protein generation."
