        "title": "Progress in kidney transplantation: The role for systems immunology",
        "abstract": "The development of systems biology represents an immense breakthrough in our ability to perform translational research and deliver personalized and precision medicine. A multidisciplinary approach in combination with use of novel techniques allows for the extraction and analysis of vast quantities of data even from the volume and source limited samples that can be obtained from human subjects. Continued advances in microfluidics, scalability and affordability of sequencing technologies, and development of data analysis tools have made the application of a multi-omics, or systems, approach more accessible for use outside of specialized centers. The study of alloimmune and protective immune responses after solid organ transplant offers innumerable opportunities for a multi-omics approach, however, transplant immunology labs are only just beginning to adopt the systems methodology. In this review, we focus on advances in biological techniques and how they are improving our understanding of the immune system and its interactions, highlighting potential applications in transplant immunology. First, we describe the techniques that are available, with emphasis on major advances that allow for increased scalability. Then, we review initial applications in the field of transplantation with a focus on topics that are nearing clinical integration. Finally, we examine major barriers to adapting these methods and discuss potential future developments."
