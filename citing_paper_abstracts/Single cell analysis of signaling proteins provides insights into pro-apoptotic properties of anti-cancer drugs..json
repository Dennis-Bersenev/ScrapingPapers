        "title": "Single cell analysis of signaling proteins provides insights into pro-apoptotic properties of anti-cancer drugs.",
        "abstract": "Single cell DNA analysis technology has provided unprecedented insights into many physiological and pathological processes. In contrast, technologies that allow protein analysis in single cells have lagged behind. Herein, a method called single cell Plasmonic ImmunoSandwich Assay (scPISA) that is capable of measuring signaling proteins and protein complexes in single living cells is described. scPISA is straightforward, comprising specific in-cell extraction and ultrasensitive plasmonic detection. It is applied to evaluate the efficacy and kinetics of cytotoxic drugs. It reveals that different drugs exhibit distinct pro-apoptotic properties at the single cell level. A set of new parameters is thus proposed for comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. It discloses that metformin can dramatically enhance the overall anti-cancer efficacy when combined with actinomycin D, though it itself is significantly less effective. Furthermore, scPISA reveals that survivin interacts with cytochrome C and caspase-3 in a dynamic fashion in single cells during continuous drug treatment. As compared with conventional assays, scPISA exhibits several significant advantages, such as ultra-high sensitivity, single-cell resolution, fast speed, and so on. Therefore, this approach may provide a powerful tool for wide important applications from basic research to clinical applications, particularly precision medicine."
