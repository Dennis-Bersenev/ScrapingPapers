        "title": "Comprehensive benchmarking of CITE-seq versus DOGMA-seq single cell multimodal omics",
        "abstract": "The recently developed method TEA-seq and similar DOGMA-seq single cell trimodal omics assays provide unprecedented opportunities for understanding cell biology, but independent evaluation is lacking. We explore the utility of DOGMA-seq compared to the bimodal CITE-seq assay in activated and stimulated human peripheral blood T cells. We find that single cell trimodal omics measurements after digitonin (DIG) permeabilization were generally better than after an alternative \u201clow-loss lysis\u201d (LLL) permeabilization condition. Next, we find that DOGMA-seq with optimized DIG permeabilization and its ATAC library provides more information, although its mRNA and cell surface protein libraries have slightly inferior quality, compared to CITE-seq."
