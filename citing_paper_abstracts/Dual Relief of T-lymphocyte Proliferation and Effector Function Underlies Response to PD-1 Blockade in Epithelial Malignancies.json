        "abstract": "Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells from patients with three cancer types exhibit a memory phenotype, a sequential pattern of immune checkpoint expression with additional CD39 expression, and CD28 loss. These cells' effector potential can be unleashed with anti\u2013PD-1. Although understanding of T-cell exhaustion is widely based on mouse models, its analysis in patients with cancer could provide clues indicating tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Data suggest a role for costimulatory pathways, particularly CD28, in exhausted T-cell responsiveness to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional approaches to dissect the relation between CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, CD28 costimulation, and tumor specificity in head and neck, cervical, and ovarian cancers. We found that memory tumor\u2013specific CD8+ T cells, but not bystander cells, sequentially express immune checkpoints once they infiltrate tumors, leading, in situ, to a functionally exhausted population. Exhausted T cells were nonetheless endowed with effector and tumor residency potential but exhibited loss of the costimulatory receptor CD28 in comparison with their circulating memory counterparts. Accordingly, PD-1 inhibition improved proliferation of circulating tumor\u2013specific CD8+ T cells and reversed functional exhaustion of specific T cells at tumor sites. In agreement with their tumor specificity, high infiltration of tumors by exhausted cells was predictive of response to therapy and survival in ICB-treated patients with head and neck cancer. Our results showed that PD-1 blockade\u2013mediated proliferation/reinvigoration of circulating memory T cells and local reversion of exhaustion occur concurrently to control tumors."
