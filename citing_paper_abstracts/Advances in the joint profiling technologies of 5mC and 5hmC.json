        "abstract": "DNA cytosine methylation, a crucial epigenetic modification, involves the dynamic interplay of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized form, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), generated by ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases. This process is central to regulating gene expression, influencing critical biological processes such as development, disease progression, and aging. Recognizing the distinct functions of 5mC and 5hmC, researchers often employ restriction enzyme-based or chemical treatment methods for their simultaneous measurement from the same genomic sample. This enables a detailed understanding of the relationship between these modifications and their collective impact on cellular function. This review focuses on summarizing the technologies for detecting 5mC and 5hmC together but also discusses the limitations and potential future directions in this evolving field."
