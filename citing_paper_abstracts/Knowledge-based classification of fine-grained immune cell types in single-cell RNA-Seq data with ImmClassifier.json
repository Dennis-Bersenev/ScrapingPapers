        "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing is an emerging strategy for characterizing the immune cell population in diverse environments including blood, tumor or healthy tissues. While this has traditionally been done with flow or mass cytometry targeting protein expression, scRNA-Seq has several established and potential advantages in that it can profile immune cells and non-immune cells (e.g. cancer cells) in the same sample, identify cell types that lack precise markers for flow cytometry, or identify a potentially larger number of immune cell types and activation states than is achievable in a single flow assay. However, scRNA-Seq is currently limited due to the need to identify the types of each immune cell from its transcriptional profile, which is not only time-consuming but also requires a significant knowledge of immunology. While recently developed algorithms accurately annotate coarse cell types (e.g. T cells vs macrophages), making fine distinctions has turned out to be a difficult challenge. To address this, we developed a machine learning classifier called ImmClassifier that leverages a hierarchical ontology of cell type. We demonstrate that ImmClassifier outperforms other tools (+20% recall, +14% precision) in distinguishing fine-grained cell types (e.g. CD8+ effector memory T cells) with comparable performance on coarse ones. Thus, ImmClassifier can be used to explore more deeply the heterogeneity of the immune system in scRNA-Seq experiments."
