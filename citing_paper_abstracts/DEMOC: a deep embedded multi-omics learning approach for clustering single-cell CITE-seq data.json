        "title": "DEMOC: a deep embedded multi-omics learning approach for clustering single-cell CITE-seq data",
        "abstract": "Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has provided an unprecedent opportunity for cell-type identification. As clustering is an effective strategy towards cell-type identification, various computational approaches have been proposed for clustering scRNA-seq data. Recently, with the emergence of cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), the cell surface expression of specific proteins and the RNA expression on the same cell can be captured, which provides more comprehensive information for cell analysis. However, existing single cell clustering algorithms are mainly designed for single-omic data, and have difficulties in handling multi-omics data with diverse characteristics efficiently. In this study, we propose a novel deep embedded multi-omics clustering with collaborative training (DEMOC) model to perform joint clustering on CITE-seq data. Our model can take into account the characteristics of transcriptomic and proteomic data, and make use of the consistent and complementary information provided by different data sources effectively. Experiment results on two real CITE-seq datasets demonstrate that our DEMOC model not only outperforms state-of-the-art single-omic clustering methods, but also achieves better and more stable performance than existing multi-omics clustering methods. We also apply our model on three scRNA-seq datasets to assess the performance of our model in rare cell-type identification, novel cell-subtype detection and cellular heterogeneity analysis. Experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of our model in discovering the underlying patterns of data."
