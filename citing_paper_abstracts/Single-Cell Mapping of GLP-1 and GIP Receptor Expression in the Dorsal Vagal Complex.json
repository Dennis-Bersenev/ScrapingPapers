        "title": "Single-Cell Mapping of GLP-1 and GIP Receptor Expression in the Dorsal Vagal Complex",
        "abstract": "The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the hindbrain, composed of the area postrema, nucleus of the solitary tract, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, plays a critical role in modulating satiety. The incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) act directly in the brain to modulate feeding, and receptors for both are expressed in the DVC. Given the impressive clinical responses to pharmacologic manipulation of incretin signaling, understanding the central mechanisms by which incretins alter metabolism and energy balance is of critical importance. Here, we review recent single-cell approaches used to detect molecular signatures of GLP-1 and GIP receptor\u2013expressing cells in the DVC. In addition, we discuss how current advancements in single-cell transcriptomics, epigenetics, spatial transcriptomics, and circuit mapping techniques have the potential to further characterize incretin receptor circuits in the hindbrain."
