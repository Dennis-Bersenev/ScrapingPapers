        "abstract": "Single-cell measurements of cellular characteristics have been instrumental in understanding the heterogeneous pathways that drive differentiation, cellular responses to extracellular signals, and human disease states. scATAC-seq has been particularly challenging due to the large size of the human genome and processing artefacts resulting from DNA damage that are an inherent source of background signal. Downstream analysis and integration of scATAC-seq with other single-cell assays is complicated by the lack of clear phenotypic information linking chromatin state and cell type. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases the signal-to-noise ratio and allows simultaneous measurement of cell surface markers: Integrated Cellular Indexing of Chromatin Landscape and Epitopes (ICICLE-seq). We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay to simultaneously measure Transcriptomic state (scRNA-seq), cell surface Epitopes, and chromatin Accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types."
