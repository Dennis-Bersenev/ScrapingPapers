        "abstract": "Myeloid neoplasms (MN) are heterogeneous clonal disorders arising from the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In parallel with genetic and epigenetic dynamics, the immune system plays a critical role in modulating tumorigenesis, evolution and therapeutic resistance at the various stages of disease progression. Single-cell technologies represent powerful tools to assess the cellular composition of the complex tumor ecosystem and its immune environment, to dissect interactions between neoplastic and non-neoplastic components, and to decipher their functional heterogeneity and plasticity. In addition, recent progress in multi-omics approaches provide an unprecedented opportunity to study multiple molecular layers (DNA, RNA, proteins) at the level of single-cell or single cellular clones during disease evolution or in response to therapy. Applying single-cell technologies to MN holds the promise to uncover novel cell subsets or phenotypic states and highlight the connections between clonal evolution and immune escape, which is crucial to fully understand disease progression and therapeutic resistance. This review provides a perspective on the various opportunities and challenges in the field, focusing on key questions in MN research and discussing their translational value, particularly for the development of more efficient immunotherapies."
