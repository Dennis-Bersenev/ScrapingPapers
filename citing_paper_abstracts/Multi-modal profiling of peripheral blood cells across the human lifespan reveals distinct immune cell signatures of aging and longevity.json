        "abstract": "Age-related changes in immune cell composition and functionality are associated with multimorbidity and mortality. However, many centenarians delay the onset of aging-related disease suggesting the presence of elite immunity that remains highly functional at extreme old age. To identify immune-specific patterns of aging and extreme human longevity, we analyzed novel single cell profiles from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 7 centenarians (mean age 106) and publicly available single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets that included an additional 7 centenarians as well as 52 people at younger ages (20-89 years). The analysis confirmed known shifts in the ratio of lymphocytes to myeloid cells, and noncytotoxic to cytotoxic cell distributions with aging, but also identified significant shifts from CD4+ T cell to B cell populations in centenarians suggesting a history of exposure to natural and environmental immunogens. Our transcriptional analysis identified cell type signatures specific to exceptional longevity that included genes with age-related changes (e.g., increased expression of STK17A, a gene known to be involved in DNA damage response) as well as genes expressed uniquely in centenarians\u2019 PBMCs (e.g., S100A4, part of the S100 protein family studied in age-related disease and connected to longevity and metabolic regulation). Collectively, these data suggest that centenarians harbor unique, highly functional immune systems that have successfully adapted to a history of insults allowing for the achievement of exceptional longevity."
