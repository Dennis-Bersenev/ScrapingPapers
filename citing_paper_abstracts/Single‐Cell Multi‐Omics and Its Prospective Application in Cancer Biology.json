        "abstract": "In recent years, the emergence of single\u2010cell omics technologies, which can profile genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics, has provided unprecedented insights into characteristics of cancer, enabling higher resolution and accuracy to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms relating to tumorigenesis, evolution, metastasis, and immune responses. Single\u2010cell multi\u2010omics technologies, which are developed based on the combination of multiple single\u2010cell mono\u2010omics technologies, can simultaneously analyze RNA expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, epigenetic modification, or protein abundance, enabling the in\u2010depth understanding of gene expression regulatory mechanisms. In this review, the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art single\u2010cell multi\u2010omics technologies are summarized and the prospects of their application in cancer biology are discussed."
