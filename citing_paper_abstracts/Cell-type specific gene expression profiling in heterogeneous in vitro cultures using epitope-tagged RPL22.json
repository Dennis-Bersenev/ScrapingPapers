        "title": "Cell-type specific gene expression profiling in heterogeneous in vitro cultures using epitope-tagged RPL22",
        "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) allow the production of defined, disease relevant cell types for transcriptomic and functional studies. A major challenge for hiPSCs disease modeling is to more closely mimic heterocellular networks observed in vivo. As hiPSC cultures become more complex, measuring cell-type specific transcriptomics will become more challenging. Here we report an extension of the RiboTag system, which uses cell-type restricted expression of epitope-tagged RPL22 in mouse tissue, applied to immortalized cell lines, primary mouse astrocytes, and hiPSC-derived neural cells. We constructed lentiviral vectors expressing epitope-tagged RPL22 using constitutive and inducible promoters fused to HA, Flag, or V5 affinity tags in combination with fluorescent reporters; differential expression of uniquely tagged RPL22 in specific cell types allows mRNA from each population to be biochemically purified from mixed cultures. RiboTag expression enables efficient depletion of off-target RNA in mixed species co-cultures of immortalized cell lines using HA and V5 RiboTags. In monocultures of hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells, motor neurons, and GABAergic neurons expressing RiboTags, we observed an enrichment of protein coding genes and concomitant decrease in mitochondrial and non-coding genes in immunoprecipitated RNA. Depletion efficiency varied across independent replicates of mixed-species co-cultures of hiPSC-derived motor neurons and primary mouse astrocytes. The challenges and potential of implementing RiboTags in complex in vitro cultures are discussed."
