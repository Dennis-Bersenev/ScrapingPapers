        "title": "Myeloid Heterogeneity in Kidney Disease as Revealed through Single-Cell RNA Sequencing",
        "abstract": "Kidney disease represents a global health burden of increasing prevalence and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Myeloid cells are a major cellular compartment of the immune system; they are found in the healthy kidney and in increased numbers in the damaged and/or diseased kidney, where they act as key players in the progression of injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. They possess enormous plasticity and heterogeneity, adopting different phenotypic and functional characteristics in response to stimuli in the local milieu. Although this inherent complexity remains to be fully understood in the kidney, advances in single-cell genomics promise to change this. Specifically, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has had a transformative effect on kidney research, enabling the profiling and analysis of the transcriptomes of single cells at unprecedented resolution and throughput, and subsequent generation of cell atlases. Moving forward, combining scRNA- and single-nuclear RNA-seq with greater-resolution spatial transcriptomics will allow spatial mapping of kidney disease of varying etiology to further reveal the patterning of immune cells and nonimmune renal cells. This review summarizes the roles of myeloid cells in kidney health and disease, the experimental workflow in currently available scRNA-seq technologies, and published findings using scRNA-seq in the context of myeloid cells and the kidney."
