        "title": "Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a novel cell type and immunotherapeutic 1 targets in papillary thyroid cancer",
        "abstract": "30 Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy. Although 31 PTC usually has a favorable prognosis, some aggressive PTC subtypes and lymph 32 node (LN) metastasis contribute to high rates of recurrence and poor clinical 33 outcomes. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 15 34 samples, including primary tumors of PTC, metastatic LNs, and paracancerous tissues. 35 After quality filtering, 28,205 cells were detected. Of these, 13,390 cells originated 36 from 7 tumor tissues, 2,869 cells from 2 metastatic LNs, and 11,945 cells from 6 37 paracancerous tissues. The increase in the proportion of CD4 + Tregs may be a key 38 factor responsible for the immunosuppressive property of PTC. A novel cell type was 39 identified, named Protective EGR1 + CD4 + T cell, which might be antagonistic to the 40 CD4 + Tregs and inhibit the formation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment 41 and tumor immune evasion. Inhibitory checkpoints TIGIT and CD96 were found to be 42 better targets than PD-1 for immune therapy in PTC patients with LN metastasis. For 43 PTC patients without LN metastasis, however, PD-1, TIGIT, and CD96 could be 44 suitable targets of immunotherapy. These findings would contribute to the further 45 understanding of molecular mechanisms resulting in occurrence and development of 46 PTC, and provide a theoretical rationale for targeted therapy and immunotherapy. 47 51 metastasis than PDCD1 (PD-1). These findings would contribute to the further understanding of molecular mechanisms resulting in occurrence and development of PTC, and provide a theoretical rationale for targeted therapy and immunotherapy."
