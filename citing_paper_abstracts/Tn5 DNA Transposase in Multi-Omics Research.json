        "title": "Tn5 DNA Transposase in Multi-Omics Research",
        "abstract": "Tn5 transposase use in biotechnology has substantially advanced the sequencing applications of genome-wide analysis of cells. This is mainly due to the ability of Tn5 transposase to efficiently transpose DNA essentially randomly into any target DNA without the aid of other factors. This concise review is focused on the advances in Tn5 applications in multi-omics technologies, genome-wide profiling, and Tn5 hybrid molecule creation. The possibilities of other transposase uses are also discussed."
