        "abstract": "Single cell western blot (scWB) is one of the most important methods for cellular heterogeneity profiling. However, current scWB based on conventional photoactive polyacrylamide hydrogel material suffers from the tradeoff between in\u2010gel probing and separation resolution. Here, a highly sensitive temperature\u2010controlled single\u2010cell western blotting (tc\u2010scWB) method is introduced, which is based on a thermo/photo\u2010dualistic\u2010sensitive polyacrylamide hydrogel, namely acrylic acid\u2010functionalized graphene oxide (AFGO) assisted, N\u2010isopropylacrylamide modified polyacrylamide (ANP) hydrogel. The ANP hydrogel is contracted at high\u2010temperature to constrain protein band diffusion during microchip electrophoretic separation, while the gel aperture is expanded under low\u2010temperature for better antibody penetration into the hydrogel. The tc\u2010scWB method enables the separation and profiling of small\u2010molecule\u2010weight proteins with highly crosslinked gel (12% T) in SDS\u2010PAGE. The tc\u2010scWB is demonstrated on three metabolic and ER stress\u2010specific proteins (CHOP, MDH2 and FH) in four pancreatic cell subtypes, revealing the expression of key enzymes in the Krebs cycle is upregulated with enhanced ER stress. It is found that ER stress can regulate crucial enzyme (MDH2 and FH) activities of metabolic cascade in cancer cells, boosting aerobic respiration to attenuate the Warburg effect and promote cell apoptosis. The tc\u2010scWB is a general toolbox for the analysis of low\u2010abundance small\u2010molecular functional proteins at the single\u2010cell level."
