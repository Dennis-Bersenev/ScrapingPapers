        "title": "Immunology in the Era of Single-Cell Technologies.",
        "abstract": "Immune cells are characterized by diversity, specificity, plasticity, and adaptability-properties that enable them to contribute to homeostasis and respond specifically and dynamically to the many threats encountered by the body. Single-cell technologies, including the assessment of transcriptomics, genomics, and proteomics at the level of individual cells, are ideally suited to studying these properties of immune cells. In this review we discuss the benefits of adopting single-cell approaches in studying underappreciated qualities of immune cells and highlight examples where these technologies have been critical to advancing our understanding of the immune system in health and disease. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Immunology, Volume 38 is April 26, 2020. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
