        "title": "Systems vaccinology and big data in the vaccine development chain",
        "abstract": "Systems vaccinology has proven a fascinating development in the last decade. Where traditionally vaccine development has been dominated by trial and error, systems vaccinology is a tool that provides novel and comprehensive understanding if properly used. Data sets retrieved from systems\u2010based studies endorse rational design and effective development of safe and efficacious vaccines. In this review we first describe different omics\u2010techniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology. In the second part, the application of systems vaccinology in the different stages of vaccine development is described. Overall, this review shows that systems vaccinology has become an important tool anywhere in the vaccine development chain."
