        "title": "High-dimensional immune-profiling in cancer: implications for immunotherapy",
        "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field for cancer treatment. In contrast to conventional cancer therapies, immunotherapeutic strategies focus on reactivating the immune system to mount an antitumor response. Despite the encouraging outcome in clinical trials, a large proportion of patients still do not respond to treatment and many experience different degrees of immune-related adverse events. Furthermore, it is now increasingly appreciated that even many conventional cancer therapies such as radiotherapy could have a positive impact on the host immune system for better clinical response. Hence, there is a need to better understand tumor immunity in order to design immunotherapeutic strategies, especially evidence-based combination therapies, for improved clinical outcomes. With this aim, cancer research turned its attention to profiling the immune contexture of either the tumor microenvironment (TME) or peripheral blood to uncover mechanisms and biomarkers which might aid in precision immunotherapeutics. Conventional technologies used for this purpose were limited by the depth and dimensionality of the data. Advances in newer techniques have, however, greatly improved the breadth and depth, as well as the quantity and quality of data that can be obtained. The result of these advances is a wealth of new information and insights on how the TME could be affected by various immune cell-types, and how this might in turn impact the clinical outcome of cancer patients . We highlight herein some of the high-dimensional technologies currently employed in immune profiling in cancer and summarize the insights and potential benefits they could bring in designing better cancer immunotherapies."
