        "title": "From multitude to singularity: An up-to-date overview of scRNA-seq data generation and analysis",
        "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is today a common and powerful technology in biomedical research settings, allowing to profile the whole transcriptome of a very large number of individual cells and reveal the heterogeneity of complex clinical samples. Traditionally, cells have been classified by their morphology or by expression of certain proteins in functionally distinct settings. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies paved the way for the detection and quantitative analysis of cellular content. In this context, transcriptome quantification techniques made their advent, starting from the bulk RNA sequencing, unable to dissect the heterogeneity of a sample, and moving to the first single cell techniques capable of analyzing a small number of cells (1\u2013100), arriving at the current single cell techniques able to generate hundreds of thousands of cells. As experimental protocols have improved rapidly, computational workflows for processing the data have also been refined, opening up to novel methods capable of scaling computational times more favorably with the dataset size and making scRNA-seq much better suited for biomedical research. In this perspective, we will highlight the key technological and computational developments which have enabled the analysis of this growing data, making the scRNA-seq a handy tool in clinical applications."
