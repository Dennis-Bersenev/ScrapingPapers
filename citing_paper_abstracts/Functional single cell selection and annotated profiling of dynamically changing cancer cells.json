        "abstract": "A method connecting single cell genomic or transcriptomic profiles to functional cellular characteristics, in particular time-varying phenotypic changes, would be transformative for single cell and cancer biology. Here, we present fSCS: functional single cell selection. This technology combines a custom-built ultrawide field-of-view optical screening microscope, fast automated image analysis and a new photolabeling method, phototagging, using a newly synthesized visible-light-photoactivatable dye. Using fSCS, we screen, selectively photolabel and isolate cells of interest from large heterogeneous populations based on functional dynamics like fast migration, morphological variation, small molecule uptake or cell division. We combined fSCS with single cell RNA sequencing for functionally annotated transcriptomic profiling of fast migrating and spindle-shaped MCF10A cells with or without TGF\u03b2 induction. We identified critical genes and pathways driving aggressive migration as well as mesenchymal-like morphology that could not be detected with state-of-the-art single cell transcriptomic analysis. fSCS provides a crucial upstream selection paradigm for single cell sequencing independent of biomarkers, allows enrichment of rare cells and can facilitate the identification and understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying functional phenotypes."
