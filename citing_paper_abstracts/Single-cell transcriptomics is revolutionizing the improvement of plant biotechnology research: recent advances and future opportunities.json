        "abstract": "Abstract Single-cell approaches are a promising way to obtain high-resolution transcriptomics data and have the potential to revolutionize the study of plant growth and development. Recent years have seen the advent of unprecedented technological advances in the field of plant biology to study the transcriptional information of individual cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This review focuses on the modern advancements of single-cell transcriptomics in plants over the past few years. In addition, it also offers a new insight of how these emerging methods will expedite advance research in plant biotechnology in the near future. Lastly, the various technological hurdles and inherent limitations of single-cell technology that need to be conquered to develop such outstanding possible knowledge gain is critically analyzed and discussed."
