        "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are now recognized as one of the major root causes of therapy failure and tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Early studies in the field focused primarily on the intrinsic regulators of CSC maintenance, but in recent years, mounting evidence has demonstrated the presence and role of extrinsic regulators in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the control of liver CSCs. In addition to direct interaction with cellular components, noncellular components, including the extracellular matrix, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and secreted molecules within the tumor stroma and hepatitis viruses, also play a critical role in shaping the CSC niche. In this review, we highlight how various noncellular components in the TME play a role in regulating CSCs and how CSCs secrete components to interact with the TME to generate their own niche, working hand in hand to drive tumor physiology in HCC. In addition, we describe the potential clinical applications of these findings and propose perspectives on future research of noncellular components in the liver CSC niche."
