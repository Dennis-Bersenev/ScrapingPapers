        "title": "High Throughput Multi-Omics Approaches for Clinical Trial Evaluation and Drug Discovery",
        "abstract": "High throughput single cell multi-omics platforms, such as mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight; CyTOF), high dimensional imaging (>6 marker; Hyperion, MIBIscope, CODEX, MACSima) and the recently evolved genomic cytometry (Citeseq or REAPseq) have enabled unprecedented insights into many biological and clinical questions, such as hematopoiesis, transplantation, cancer, and autoimmunity. In synergy with constantly adapting new single-cell analysis approaches and subsequent accumulating big data collections from these platforms, whole atlases of cell types and cellular and sub-cellular interaction networks are created. These atlases build an ideal scientific discovery environment for reference and data mining approaches, which often times reveals new cellular disease networks. In this review we will discuss how combinations and fusions of different -omic workflows on a single cell level can be used to examine cellular phenotypes, immune effector functions, and even dynamic changes, such as metabolomic state of different cells in a sample or even in a defined tissue location. We will touch on how pre-print platforms help in optimization and reproducibility of workflows, as well as community outreach. We will also shortly discuss how leveraging single cell multi-omic approaches can be used to accelerate cellular biomarker discovery during clinical trials to predict response to therapy, follow responsive cell types, and define novel druggable target pathways. Single cell proteome approaches already have changed how we explore cellular mechanism in disease and during therapy. Current challenges in the field are how we share these disruptive technologies to the scientific communities while still including new approaches, such as genomic cytometry and single cell metabolomics."
