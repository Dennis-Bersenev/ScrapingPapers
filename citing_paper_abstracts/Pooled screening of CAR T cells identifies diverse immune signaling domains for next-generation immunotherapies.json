        "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) repurpose natural signaling components to retarget T cells to refractory cancers but have shown limited efficacy in persistent, recurrent malignancies. Here, we introduce \u201cCAR Pooling,\u201d a multiplexed approach to rapidly identify CAR designs with clinical potential. Forty CARs with signaling domains derived from a range of immune cell lineages were evaluated in pooled assays for their ability to stimulate critical T cell effector functions during repetitive stimulation that mimics long-term tumor antigen exposure. Several domains were identified from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family that have been primarily associated with B cells. CD40 enhanced proliferation, whereas B cell\u2013activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) and transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) promoted cytotoxicity. These functions were enhanced relative to clinical benchmarks after prolonged antigen stimulation, and CAR T cell signaling through these domains fell into distinct states of memory, cytotoxicity, and metabolism. BAFF-R CAR T cells were enriched for a highly cytotoxic transcriptional signature previously associated with positive clinical outcomes. We also observed that replacing the 4-1BB intracellular signaling domain with the BAFF-R signaling domain in a clinically validated B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)\u2013specific CAR resulted in enhanced activity in a xenotransplant model of multiple myeloma. Together, these results show that CAR Pooling is a general approach for rapid exploration of CAR architecture and activity to improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapies. Description CAR Pooling is a high-throughput approach to screening and testing CAR designs with the potential to enhance engineered T cell therapies for cancer. Test driving CAR T cells CAR T cells have already been through multiple generations, with each iteration improving signaling through the receptor. However, a strategy to broadly test multiple candidate intracellular signaling domains would allow for even better optimization. Here, Goodman et al. have developed CAR Pooling, a multiplexed approach to rapidly identify the top CAR signaling domains. The authors found using CAR Pooling that the intracellular signaling domain from BAFF-R improved CAR T cell activity; these results translated into control of tumor burden in vivo. Thus, CAR Pooling represents an effective approach to rapidly identify strategies to improve CAR T cells."
