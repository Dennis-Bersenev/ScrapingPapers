        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field with exponential advancement in engineered immune cell-based therapies. For instance, an engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) can be introduced in T-cells or other immune cells and adoptively transferred to target and kill cancer cells in hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. The first CAR-T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has been developed against CD19, a B-cell marker expressed on lymphoma and lymphoblastic leukemia. To allow for personalized treatment, proteomics approaches could provide insights into biomarkers for CAR-T therapy efficacy and toxicity. Areas Covered We researched the most recent technology methods of biomarker evaluation used in the laboratory and clinical setting. Publications of CAR-T biomarkers were then systematically reviewed to provide a narrative of the most validated biomarkers of CAR-T efficacy and toxicity. Examples of biomarkers include CAR-T functionality and phenotype as well as interleukin-6 and other cytokines. Expert Commentary Biomarkers of CAR-T efficacy and toxicity have been identified, but still need to be validated and standardized across institutions. Moreover, few are used in the clinical setting due to limitations in real-time technology. Expansion of biomarker research could provide better understanding of patient response and risk of life-threatening side effects with potential for improved precision medicine."
