        "title": "Single-cell glycomics analysis by CyTOF-Lec reveals glycan features defining cells differentially susceptible to HIV",
        "abstract": "High-parameter single-cell phenotyping has enabled in-depth classification and interrogation of immune cells, but to date has not allowed for glycan characterization. Here, we develop CyTOF-Lec as an approach to simultaneously characterize many protein and glycan features of human immune cells at the single-cell level. We implemented CyTOF-Lec to compare glycan features between different immune subsets from blood and multiple tissue compartments, and to characterize HIV-infected cell cultures. Using bioinformatics approaches to distinguish preferential infection of cellular subsets from viral-induced remodeling, we demonstrate that HIV upregulates the levels of cell-surface fucose and sialic acid in a cell-intrinsic manner, and that memory CD4+ T cells co-expressing high levels of fucose and sialic acid are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Sialic acid levels were found to distinguish memory CD4+ T cell subsets expressing different amounts of viral entry receptors, pro-survival factors, homing receptors, and activation markers, and to play a direct role in memory CD4+ T cells\u2019 susceptibility to HIV infection. The ability of sialic acid to distinguish memory CD4+ T cells with different susceptibilities to HIV infection was experimentally validated through sorting experiments. Together, these results suggest that HIV remodels not only cellular proteins but also glycans, and that glycan expression can differentiate memory CD4+ T cells with vastly different susceptibility to HIV infection."
