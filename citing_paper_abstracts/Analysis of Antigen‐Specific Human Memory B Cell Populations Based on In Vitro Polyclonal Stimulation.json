        "abstract": "Antigen\u2010specific memory B cell (MBC) populations mediate the rapid, strong, and high\u2010affinity secondary antibody responses that play a key role in combating infection and generating protective responses to vaccination. Recently, cell staining with fluorochrome\u2010labeled antigens together with sequencing methods such as Drop\u2010seq and CITE\u2010seq have provided information on the specificity, phenotype, and transcriptome of single MBCs. However, characterization of MBCs at the level of antigen\u2010reactive populations remains an important tool for assessing an individual's B cell immunity and responses to antigen exposure. This is readily performed using a long\u2010established method based on in vitro polyclonal stimulation of MBCs to induce division and differentiation into antibody\u2010secreting cells (ASCs). Post\u2010stimulation antigen\u2010specific measurement of the MBC\u2010derived ASCs (or the secreted antibodies) indicates the size of precursor MBC populations. Additional information about the character of antigen\u2010reactive MBC populations is provided by analysis of MBC\u2010derived antibodies of particular specificities for binding avidity and functionality. This article outlines a simple and reliable strategy for efficient in vitro MBC stimulation and use of the ELISpot assay as a post\u2010stimulation readout to determine the size of antigen\u2010specific MBC populations. Other applications of the in vitro stimulation technique for MBC analysis are discussed. The following protocols are included. \u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC"
