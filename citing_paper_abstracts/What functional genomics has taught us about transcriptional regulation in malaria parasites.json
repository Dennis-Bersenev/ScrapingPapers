        "title": "What functional genomics has taught us about transcriptional regulation in malaria parasites",
        "abstract": "Abstract Malaria parasites are characterized by a complex life cycle that is accompanied by dynamic gene expression patterns. The factors and mechanisms that regulate gene expression in these parasites have been searched for even before the advent of next generation sequencing technologies. Functional genomics approaches have substantially boosted this area of research and have yielded significant insights into the interplay between epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, considerable progress has been made in identifying sequence-specific transcription factors and DNA-encoded regulatory elements. Here, we review the insights obtained from these efforts including the characterization of core promoters, the involvement of sequence-specific transcription factors in life cycle progression and the mapping of gene regulatory elements. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments in the field of functional genomics and how they might contribute to further characterization of this complex gene regulatory network."
