        "title": "Integrating Micro and Nano Technologies for Cell Engineering and Analysis: Toward the Next Generation of Cell Therapy Workflows.",
        "abstract": "The emerging field of cell therapy offers the potential to treat and even cure a diverse array of diseases for which existing interventions are inadequate. Recent advances in micro and nanotechnology have added a multitude of single cell analysis methods to our research repertoire. At the same time, techniques have been developed for the precise engineering and manipulation of cells. Together, these methods have aided the understanding of disease pathophysiology, helped formulate corrective interventions at the cellular level, and expanded the spectrum of available cell therapeutic options. This review discusses how micro and nanotechnology have catalyzed the development of cell sorting, cellular engineering, and single cell analysis technologies, which have become essential workflow components in developing cell-based therapeutics. The review focuses on the technologies adopted in research studies and explores the opportunities and challenges in combining the various elements of cell engineering and single cell analysis into the next generation of integrated and automated platforms that can accelerate preclinical studies and translational research."
