        "title": "Genomic Cytometry and New Modalities for Deep Single\u2010Cell Interrogation",
        "abstract": "In the past few years, the rapid development of single\u2010cell analysis techniques has allowed for increasingly in\u2010depth analysis of DNA, RNA, protein, and epigenetic states, at the level of the individual cell. This unprecedented characterization ability has been enabled through the combination of cytometry, microfluidics, genomics, and informatics. Although traditionally discrete, when properly integrated, these fields create the synergistic field of Genomic Cytometry. In this review, we look at the individual methods that together gave rise to the broad field of Genomic Cytometry. We further outline the basic concepts that drive the field and provide a framework to understand this increasingly complex, technology\u2010intensive space. Thus, we introduce Genomic Cytometry as an emerging field and propose that synergistic rationalization of disparate modalities of cytometry, microfluidics, genomics, and informatics under one banner will enable massive leaps forward in the understanding of complex biology. \u00a9 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry"
