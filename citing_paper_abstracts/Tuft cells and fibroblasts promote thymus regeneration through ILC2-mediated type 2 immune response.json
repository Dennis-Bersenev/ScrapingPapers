        "abstract": "The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that is essential for the establishment of adaptive immunity through generation of immunocompetent T cells. In response to various stress signals, the thymus undergoes acute but reversible involution. However, the mechanisms governing its recovery are incompletely understood. Here, we used a dexamethasone-induced acute thymic involution mouse model to investigate how thymic hematopoietic cells (excluding T cells) contribute to thymic regeneration. scRNA-seq analysis revealed marked transcriptional and cellular changes in various thymic populations and highlighted thymus-resident innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2) as a key cell type involved in the response to damage. We identified that ILC2 are activated by the alarmins IL-25 and IL-33 produced in response to tissue damage by thymic tuft cells and fibroblasts, respectively. Moreover, using mouse models deficient in either tuft cells and/or IL-33, we found that these alarmins are required for effective thymus regeneration after dexamethasone-induced damage. We also demonstrate that upon their damage-dependent activation, thymic ILC2 produce several effector molecules linked to tissue regeneration, such as amphiregulin and IL-13, which in turn promote thymic epithelial cell differentiation. Collectively, our study elucidates a previously undescribed role for thymic tuft cells and fibroblasts in thymus regeneration through activation of the type 2 immune response. Thymus regeneration upon glucocorticoid-induced acute involution is orchestrated by IL-25\u2013 and IL-33\u2013dependent activation of ILC2. Editor\u2019s summary The thymus undergoes transient but reversible involution in response to stress stimuli, but the molecular mechanisms mediating thymic regeneration after involution are not well defined. Nevo et al. performed scRNA-seq on the thymic non\u2013T cell compartment after dexamethasone-induced acute thymic involution (ATI) in mice. Dexamethasone-induced ATI promoted a type 2 immune response driven by thymic resident ILC2s that were activated in response to tissue damage by IL-25 produced by thymic tuft cells and IL-33 produced by fibroblasts. ILC2s facilitated tissue regeneration by producing effector molecules including AREG, IL-13, CSF2, and IL-5, which promoted mTEC differentiation. Together, these findings identify a thymic tuft cell\u2013fibroblast\u2013ILC2 axis required for thymic regeneration after ATI. \u2014Hannah Isles"
