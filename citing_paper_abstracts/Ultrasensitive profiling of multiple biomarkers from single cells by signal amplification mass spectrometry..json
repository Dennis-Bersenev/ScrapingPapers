        "abstract": "A signal amplification protocol based on mass spectrometry (MS) was developed to profile simultaneously multiple biomarkers from a single cell using various mass label (ML)-modified Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). The strategy with ultrahigh sensitivity and specificity has potential prospects in the deep exploration of molecular and cellular characterization."
