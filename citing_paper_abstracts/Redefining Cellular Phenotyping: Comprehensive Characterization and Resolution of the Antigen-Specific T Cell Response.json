        "abstract": "Adaptive immunity requires the ability to respond to different types of antigens, activate pathways that eliminate specific pathogens, and develop immunological memory so that subsequent infections or disease can be quickly identified and removed. This complex process is mediated through the specific recognition of antigens by T and B cells, and the dynamics of the immune response are fueled by the genetic diversity of Tand B-cell receptors."
