        "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is quite prevalent in studying transcriptomes, but it suffers from excessive zeros, some of which are true, but others are false. False zeros, which can be seen as missing data, obstruct the downstream analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. How to distinguish true zeros from false ones is the key point of this problem. Here, we propose sparsity-penalized stacked denoising autoencoders (scSDAEs) to impute scRNA-seq data. scSDAEs adopt stacked denoising autoencoders with a sparsity penalty, as well as a layer-wise pretraining procedure to improve model fitting. scSDAEs can capture nonlinear relationships among the data and incorporate information about the observed zeros. We tested the imputation efficiency of scSDAEs on recovering the true values of gene expression and helping downstream analysis. First, we show that scSDAE can recover the true values and the sample\u2013sample correlations of bulk sequencing data with simulated noise. Next, we demonstrate that scSDAEs accurately impute RNA mixture dataset with different dilutions, spike-in RNA concentrations affected by technical zeros, and improves the consistency of RNA and protein levels in CITE-seq data. Finally, we show that scSDAEs can help downstream clustering analysis. In this study, we develop a deep learning-based method, scSDAE, to impute single-cell RNA-seq affected by technical zeros. Furthermore, we show that scSDAEs can recover the true values, to some extent, and help downstream analysis."
