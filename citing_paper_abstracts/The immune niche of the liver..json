        "title": "The immune niche of the liver.",
        "abstract": "The liver is an essential organ that is critical for the removal of toxins, the production of proteins, and the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. Behind each liver functional unit, termed lobules, hides a heterogeneous, complex, and well-orchestrated system. Despite parenchymal cells being most commonly associated with the liver's primary functionality, it has become clear that it is the immune niche of the liver that plays a central role in maintaining both local and systemic homeostasis by propagating hepatic inflammation and orchestrating its resolution. As such, the immunological processes that are at play in healthy and diseased livers are being investigated thoroughly in order to understand the underpinnings of inflammation and the potential avenues for restoring homeostasis. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the immune niche of the liver and provides perspectives for how the implementation of new transcriptomic, multimodal, and spatial technologies can uncover the heterogeneity, plasticity, and location of hepatic immune populations. Findings from these technologies will further our understanding of liver biology and create a new framework for the identification of therapeutic targets."
