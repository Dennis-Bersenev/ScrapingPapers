        "title": "Immunotherapy in the Treatment of Urothelial Bladder Cancer: Insights From Single-Cell Analysis",
        "abstract": "Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is a global challenge of public health with limited therapeutic options. Although the emergence of cancer immunotherapy, most notably immune checkpoint inhibitors, represents a major breakthrough in the past decade, many patients still suffer from unsatisfactory clinical outcome. A thorough understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for antitumor immunity may lead to optimized treatment guidelines and new immunotherapeutic strategies. With technological developments and protocol refinements, single-cell approaches have become powerful tools that provide unprecedented insights into the kaleidoscopic tumor microenvironment and intricate cell-cell communications. In this review, we summarize recent applications of single-cell analysis in characterizing the UBC multicellular ecosystem, and discuss how to leverage the high-resolution information for more effective immune-based therapies."
