        "abstract": "Single\u2010cell technologies have revolutionized research in the last decade, including for skin biology. Single\u2010cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool allowing the dissection of human disease pathophysiology at unprecedented resolution by assessing cell\u2010to\u2010cell variation, facilitating identification of rare cell populations and elucidating cellular heterogeneity. In dermatology, this technology has been widely applied to inflammatory skin disorders, fibrotic skin diseases, wound healing complications and cutaneous neoplasms. Here, we discuss the available technologies and technical considerations of single\u2010cell RNA sequencing and describe its applications to a broad spectrum of dermatological diseases."
