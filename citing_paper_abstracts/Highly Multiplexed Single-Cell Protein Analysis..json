        "title": "Highly Multiplexed Single-Cell Protein Analysis.",
        "abstract": "Single-cell proteomic analysis is crucial to advance our understanding of normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. The comprehensive protein profiling in individual cells of a heterogeneous sample can provide new insights into many important biological issues, such as the regulation of inter- and intracellular signaling pathways or the varied cellular compositions of normal and diseased tissues. With highly multiplexed molecular imaging of many different protein biomarkers in patient biopsies, diseases can be accurately diagnosed to guide the selection of the ideal treatment. In this Minireview, we will describe the recent technological advances of single-cell proteomic assays, discuss their advantages and limitations, highlight their applications in biology and precision medicine, and present the current challenges and potential solutions."
