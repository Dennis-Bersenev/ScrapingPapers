        "title": "Heterogeneity of T Cells in Atherosclerosis Defined by Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing and Cytometry by Time of Flight",
        "abstract": "The infiltration and accumulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory leukocytes within the intimal layer of the arterial wall is a hallmark of developing and progressing atherosclerosis. While traditionally perceived as macrophage- and foam cell-dominated disease, it is now established that atherosclerosis is a partial autoimmune disease that involves the recognition of peptides from ApoB (apolipoprotein B), the core protein of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol particles, by CD4+ T-helper cells and autoantibodies against LDL and ApoB. Autoimmunity in the atherosclerotic plaque has long been understood as a pathogenic T-helper type-1 driven response with proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Recent developments in high-parametric cell immunophenotyping by mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and in tools exploring antigen-specificity have established the existence of several unforeseen layers of T-cell diversity with mixed TH1 and T regulatory cells transcriptional programs and unpredicted fates. These findings suggest that pathogenic ApoB-reactive T cells evolve from atheroprotective and immunosuppressive CD4+ T regulatory cells that lose their protective properties over time. Here, we discuss T-cell heterogeneity in atherosclerosis with a focus on plasticity, antigen-specificity, exhaustion, maturation, tissue residency, and its potential use in clinical prediction."
