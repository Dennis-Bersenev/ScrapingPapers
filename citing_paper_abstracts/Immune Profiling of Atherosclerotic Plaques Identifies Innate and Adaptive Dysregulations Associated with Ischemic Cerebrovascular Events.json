        "title": "Immune Profiling of Atherosclerotic Plaques Identifies Innate and Adaptive Dysregulations Associated with Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events",
        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is driven by multifaceted contributions of the immune system within the circulation and at vascular focal sites. Yet the specific immune dysregulations within the atherosclerotic lesions that lead to clinical cerebro- and cardiovascular complications (i.e. ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction) are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell mass cytometry with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) we found that atherosclerotic plaques were enriched in activated, differentiated, and exhausted subsets of T cells vs. blood. Next, using single-cell proteomic, transcriptomic, and cell-to-cell interaction analyses we found unique functional dysregulations of both T cells and macrophages in plaques of patients with clinically symptomatic (SYM; recent stroke of TIA) or asymptomatic (ASYM, no recent stroke) carotid artery disease. SYM plaques were enriched with a distinct CD4+ T cell subset, and T cells were activated, differentiated and presented subset specific exhaustion. SYM macrophages presented alternatively activated phenotypes including subsets associated with plaque vulnerability. In ASYM plaques, T cells and macrophages were activated and displayed a strong IL-1\u03b2 signaling across cell types, that was absent in SYM plaques. The identification of plaque-specific innate and adaptive immune dysregulations associated with cerebrovascular events provides the basis for the design of precisely tailored cardiovascular immunotherapies."
