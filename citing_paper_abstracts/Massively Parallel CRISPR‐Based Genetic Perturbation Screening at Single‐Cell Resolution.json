        "abstract": "The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\u2010based genetic screening has been demonstrated as a powerful approach for unbiased functional genomics research. Single\u2010cell CRISPR screening (scCRISPR) techniques, which result from the combination of single\u2010cell toolkits and CRISPR screening, allow dissecting regulatory networks in complex biological systems at unprecedented resolution. These methods allow cells to be perturbed en masse using a pooled CRISPR library, followed by high\u2010content phenotyping. This is technically accomplished by annotating cells with sgRNA\u2010specific barcodes or directly detectable sgRNAs. According to the integration of distinct single\u2010cell technologies, these methods principally fall into four categories: scCRISPR with RNA\u2010seq, scCRISPR with ATAC\u2010seq, scCRISPR with proteome probing, and imaging\u2010based scCRISPR. scCRISPR has deciphered genotype\u2013phenotype relationships, genetic regulations, tumor biological issues, and neuropathological mechanisms. This review provides insight into the technical breakthrough of scCRISPR by systematically summarizing the advancements of various scCRISPR methodologies and analyzing their merits and limitations. In addition, an application\u2010oriented approach guide is offered to meet researchers\u2019 individualized demands."
