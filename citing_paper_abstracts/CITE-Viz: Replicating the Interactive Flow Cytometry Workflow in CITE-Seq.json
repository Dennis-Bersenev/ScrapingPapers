        "abstract": "Summary The rapid advancement of new genomic sequencing technology has enabled the development of multi-omic single-cell sequencing assays. These assays profile multiple modalities in the same cell and can often yield new insights not revealed with a single modality. For example, CITE-Seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) simultaneously profiles the single-cell RNA transcriptome and the surface protein expression. The extra dimension of surface protein markers can be used to further identify cell clusters \u2013 an essential step for downstream analyses and interpretation. Additionally, multi-dimensional datasets like CITE-Seq require nuanced visualization methods to accurately assess the data. To facilitate cell cluster classification and visualization in CITE-Seq, we developed CITE-Viz. CITE-Viz is a single-cell visualization platform with a custom module that replicates the interactive flow-cytometry gating workflow. With CITE-Viz, users can investigate CITE-Seq specific quality control (QC) metrics, view multi-omic co-expression feature plots, and classify cell clusters by iteratively gating on the abundance of cell surface markers. CITE-Viz was developed to make multi-modal single-cell analysis accessible to a wide variety of biologists, with the aim to discover new insights into their data and to facilitate novel hypothesis generation. Availability and Implementation CITE-Viz installation and usage instructions can be found in the GitHub repository https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/CITE-Viz Contact maxsonj@ohsu.edu Supplementary Information Down-sampled peripheral blood mononuclear dataset (Hao et al. 2021): https://bit.ly/3vxbhfW"
