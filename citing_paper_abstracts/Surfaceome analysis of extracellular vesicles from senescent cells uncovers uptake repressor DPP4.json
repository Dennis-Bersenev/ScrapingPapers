        "abstract": "Significance Vast numbers of senescence-associated EVs (S-EVs) are released and carry different contents than EVs from proliferating cells (P-EVs), suggesting that they may harbor important factors critical for the senescence microenvironment and pathologies associated with age. We characterized the proteins, especially surface proteins, on P-EVs and S-EVs, and identified DPP4 as a specific marker on the surface of S-EVs. Although S-EVs were taken up by macrophages, they were refractory to uptake by many other cell types, including cancer cells. DPP4 on the surface of S-EVs appeared to function as a signal to prevent S-EVs internalization."
