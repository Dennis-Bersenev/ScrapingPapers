        "title": "New Insights into Cerebral Vessel Disease Landscapes at Single-Cell Resolution: Pathogenetic and Therapeutic Perspectives",
        "abstract": "Cerebrovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability globally. The development of new therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, vascular dementia) is limited by a lack of knowledge of the cellular and molecular biology of health and disease conditions and the factors that cause injury to cerebrovascular structures. Here, we describe the role of advances in omics technology, particularly RNA sequencing, in studying high-dimensional, multifaceted profiles of thousands of individual blood and vessel cells at single-cell resolution. This analysis enables the dissection of the heterogeneity of diseased cerebral vessels and their atherosclerotic plaques, including the microenvironment, cell evolutionary trajectory, and immune response pathway. In animal models, RNA sequencing permits the tracking of individual cells (including immunological, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle cells) that compose atherosclerotic plaques and their alteration under experimental settings such as phenotypic transition. We describe how single-cell RNA transcriptomics in humans allows mapping to the molecular and cellular levels of atherosclerotic plaques in cerebral arteries, tracking individual lymphocytes and macrophages, and how these data can aid in identifying novel immune mechanisms that could be exploited as therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases. Single-cell multi-omics approaches will likely provide the unprecedented resolution and depth of data needed to generate clinically relevant cellular and molecular signatures for the precise treatment of cerebrovascular diseases."
