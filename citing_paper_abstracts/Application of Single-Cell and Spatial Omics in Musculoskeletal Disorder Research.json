        "abstract": "Musculoskeletal disorders, including fractures, scoliosis, heterotopic ossification, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, disc degeneration, and muscular injury, etc., can occur at any stage of human life. Understanding the occurrence and development mechanism of musculoskeletal disorders, as well as the changes in tissues and cells during therapy, might help us find targeted treatment methods. Single-cell techniques provide excellent tools for studying alterations at the cellular level of disorders. However, the application of these techniques in research on musculoskeletal disorders is still limited. This review summarizes the current single-cell and spatial omics used in musculoskeletal disorders. Cell isolation, experimental methods, and feasible experimental designs for single-cell studies of musculoskeletal system diseases have been reviewed based on tissue characteristics. Then, the paper summarizes the latest findings of single-cell studies in musculoskeletal disorders from three aspects: bone and ossification, joint, and muscle and tendon disorders. Recent discoveries about the cell populations involved in these diseases are highlighted. Furthermore, the therapeutic responses of musculoskeletal disorders, especially single-cell changes after the treatments of implants, stem cell therapies, and drugs are described. Finally, the application potential and future development directions of single-cell and spatial omics in research on musculoskeletal diseases are discussed."
