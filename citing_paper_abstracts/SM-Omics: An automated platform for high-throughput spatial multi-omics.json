        "abstract": "The spatial organization of cells and molecules plays a key role in tissue function in homeostasis and disease. Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) has recently emerged as a key technique to capture and positionally barcode RNAs directly in tissues. Here, we advance the application of ST at scale, by presenting Spatial Multiomics (SM-Omics) as a fully automated high-throughput platform for combined and spatially resolved transcriptomics and antibody-based proteomics."
