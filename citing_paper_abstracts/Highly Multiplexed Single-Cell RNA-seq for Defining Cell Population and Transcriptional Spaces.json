        "title": "Highly Multiplexed Single-Cell RNA-seq for Defining Cell Population and Transcriptional Spaces",
        "abstract": "We describe a universal sample multiplexing method for single-cell RNA-seq in which cells are chemically labeled with identifying DNA oligonucleotides. Analysis of a 96-plex perturbation experiment revealed changes in cell population structure and transcriptional states that cannot be discerned from bulk measurements, establishing a cost effective means to survey cell populations from large experiments and clinical samples with the depth and resolution of single-cell RNA-seq."
