        "abstract": "Naked mole-rats (NMRs) are the longest-lived rodents yet their stem cell characteristics remain enigmatic. Here we comprehensively mapped the NMR hematopoietic landscape and identified unique features likely contributing to longevity. Adult NMRs form red blood cells in spleen and marrow, which is a neotenic trait. A myeloid bias towards granulopoiesis in concert with decreased B-lymphopoiesis defines the marrow composition, resembling fetal leukopoiesis. Very similar to primates, the primitive stem cell compartment is marked by CD34 and THY1. Remarkably, stem and progenitor respiration rates are as low as in human cells, while NMR cells show a strong expression signature for fatty acid metabolism. The pool of quiescent stem cells is higher than in mice, and the cell cycle of hematopoietic cells is prolonged. Our work provides a platform to study immunology and stem cell biology in an animal model of exceptional longevity. Teaser Juvenile features of hematopoiesis shape the blood system of the longest-lived rodent."
