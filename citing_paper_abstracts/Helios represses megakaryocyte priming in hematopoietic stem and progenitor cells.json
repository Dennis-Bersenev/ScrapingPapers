        "abstract": "The mechanism controlling lineage commitment in early hematopoiesis is unclear. Cova et al. show that the Helios transcription factor is required to actively suppress megakaryocyte priming in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which contributes to increased stem cell pluripotency and lymphoid commitment."
