        "title": "STAT3 gain-of-function mutations connect leukemia with autoimmune disease by pathological dysregulation of NKG2Dhi CD8 killer T cells",
        "abstract": "The association between cancer and autoimmune disease is unexplained, exemplified by T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL) where gain-of-function somatic mutations in STAT3 correlate with co-existing autoimmunity. To resolve whether these mutations are the cause or consequence of CD8 clonal expansions and autoimmunity, here we analyse patients with germline STAT3 GOF syndrome and mice with the T-LGL mutation STAT3K658Nor the most common germline mutation, STAT3T716M. STAT3 GOF mutations drove accumulation of effector CD8 T cell clones highly expressing the NKG2D receptor for MHC-I-related molecules expressed on stressed cells, and the genes for inflammatory/cytotoxic granzymes, perforin, interferon-\u03b3 and Ccl5/Rantes. CD8 cells were essential to lethal disease in Stat3K658Nmice and their accumulation required NKG2D and the receptor for IL-15 and IL-2, IL2RB. These results demonstrate that STAT3 GOF mutations cause effector CD8 T cell oligoclonal accumulation and that these rogue T cells contribute to autoimmune pathology, supporting the hypothesis that somatic mutations in leukemia/lymphoma driver genes contribute to autoimmune disease. IN BRIEF Leukemia and autoimmune-associated STAT3 gain-of-function mutations dysregulate CD8 T cells to cause autoimmune pathology and oligoclonal expansion of cytotoxic killer CD8 T cells, that depend upon NKG2D and IL2RB receptors for signals displayed on stressed, damaged, infected, or mutated tissues."
