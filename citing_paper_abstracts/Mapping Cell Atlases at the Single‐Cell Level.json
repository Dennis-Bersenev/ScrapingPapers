        "title": "Mapping Cell Atlases at the Single\u2010Cell Level",
        "abstract": "Recent advancements in single\u2010cell technologies have led to rapid developments in the construction of cell atlases. These atlases have the potential to provide detailed information about every cell type in different organisms, enabling the characterization of cellular diversity at the single\u2010cell level. Global efforts in developing comprehensive cell atlases have profound implications for both basic research and clinical applications. This review provides a broad overview of the cellular diversity and dynamics across various biological systems. In addition, the incorporation of machine learning techniques into cell atlas analyses opens up exciting prospects for the field of integrative biology."
