        "title": "Microfluidic Biochips for Single-Cell Isolation and Single-Cell Analysis of Multiomics and Exosomes.",
        "abstract": "Single-cell multiomic and exosome analyses are potent tools in various fields, such as cancer research, immunology, neuroscience, microbiology, and drug development. They facilitate the in-depth exploration of biological systems, providing insights into disease mechanisms and aiding in treatment. Single-cell isolation, which is crucial for single-cell analysis, ensures reliable cell isolation and quality control for further downstream analyses. Microfluidic chips are small lightweight systems that facilitate efficient and high-throughput single-cell isolation and real-time single-cell analysis on- or off-chip. Therefore, most current single-cell isolation and analysis technologies are based on the single-cell microfluidic technology. This review offers comprehensive guidance to researchers across different fields on the selection of appropriate microfluidic chip technologies for single-cell isolation and analysis. This review describes the design principles, separation mechanisms, chip characteristics, and cellular effects of various microfluidic chips available for single-cell isolation. Moreover, this review highlights the implications of using this technology for subsequent analyses, including single-cell multiomic and exosome analyses. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of microfluidic chip technology are outlined for multiplex single-cell isolation and multiomic and exosome analyses."
