The paper titled "Joint probabilistic modeling of paired transcriptom and proteome measurements in single cells" is indeed pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. 

The abstract discusses the use of CITE-seq, a technology that pairs RNA and protein measurements from single cells, which aligns with the goal of linking transcriptional data (RNA expression) to phenotypic outputs (cell surface proteins).

The key contributions of the paper that relate to your research goal include:

1. **Unified Modelling Framework:** The paper introduces Total Variational Inference (totalVI), which integrates RNA and protein data from single cells.
2. **Cohesive Solution for Analysis Tasks:** It manages dataset integration, whether protein panels are matched or unmatched, and provides tools for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression testing.
3. **Evaluation using Practical Data:** They validate their method using real-world data, enhancing its applicability and reliability for similar types of analysis.
4. **Focus on Biological and Technical Variability:** The method considers both biological factors and technical biases such as limited RNA sensitivity and background protein noise, which are crucial for accurate interpolation and interpretation of data.

Overall, the paper's focus on combined analysis of RNA and protein in a single analytical framework makes it highly relevant and potentially very useful for your research in interpolating RNA expression profiles from protein measurements.
