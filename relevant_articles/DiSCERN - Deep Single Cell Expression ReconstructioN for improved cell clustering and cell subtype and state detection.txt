The paper titled "DiSCERN - Deep Single Cell Expression ReconstructioN for improved cell clustering and cell subtype and state detection" is indeed pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. The abstract describes how DISCERN, a novel deep generative network, reconstructs missing single-cell gene expression using a reference dataset. This capability directly aligns with the goal of interpolating RNA expression data, potentially from more readily available data types such as cell surface markers.

Furthermore, the improved results in cell clustering, cell type identification, and the detection of cell states and subtype, indicate that the approach taken in this paper might provide valuable insights and tools for dealing with the limitations commonly associated with single-cell RNA sequencing data, such as sparse gene expression matrices. The application demonstrated in identifying T cell subtypes related to COVID-19 further underscores the practical relevance of DISCERN in biomedical research.

Thus, based on the title and abstract, this paper would be highly relevant and beneficial for those interested in enhancing the analysis of single cell RNA-seq data using computational methods to infer fuller expression profiles.
