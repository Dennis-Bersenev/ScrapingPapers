Based on the title and abstract provided, the paper titled "FBA: feature barcoding analysis for single cell RNA-Seq" appears to be highly pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Relevance to Single Cell RNA-Seq**: The paper discusses single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), which is the primary context in which your research goal is situated.

2. **Incorporation of Cell Surface Proteins**: The abstract mentions that recent strategies in scRNA-Seq include readouts for additional features such as cell surface proteins, which directly relates to your focus on interpolating RNA expression data based on these measurements.

3. **Feature Barcoding**: The paper introduces the concept of "feature barcoding", which involves encoding different molecular and cellular features (including cell surface protein measurements) into unique sequence barcodes detectable alongside RNA sequences. This technology is essential for linking protein expression on the cell surface to RNA expression datasets, aiding in interpolation.

4. **Tools and Techniques**: The paper highlights a software package, FBA, that supports quality control, quantification, demultiplexing, multiplet detection, clustering, and visualization specifically for feature barcoding assays. This tool could be crucial for analyzing data and generating interpolations as per your research needs.

Given these aspects, the paper should be considered relevant and potentially useful for advancing the research goal of using cell surface protein measurements to interpret or predict RNA expression profiles at the single-cell level.
