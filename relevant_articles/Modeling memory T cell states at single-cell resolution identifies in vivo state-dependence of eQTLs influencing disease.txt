Based on the title and abstract provided, the paper is indeed pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements.
The abstract mentions the integration of single-cell RNA and surface protein measurements to define continuous cell states.
This indicates that the study involves a methodology where cell surface protein data is utilized alongside RNA expression data to better understand and define the cellular states of T cells.

The paper's focus on eQTLs and their dependency on cell states derived from single-cell data including both RNA and protein measurements provides a direct relevance to the research goal
of using cell surface proteins to interpret or predict RNA expression patterns. Thus, this makes the paper a good candidate for further review and consideration within
the scope of research that involves correlating single-cell RNA expression and cell surface protein measurements.
