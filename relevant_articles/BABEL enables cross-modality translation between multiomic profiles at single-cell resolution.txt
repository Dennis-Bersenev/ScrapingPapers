Based on the title and abstract provided, the paper titled "BABEL enables cross-modality translation between multiomic profiles at single-cell resolution" is relevant to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. 

Here's a breakdown of why the paper could be pertinent:

1. **Cross-Modality Translation**: The paper focuses on a deep learning algorithm, BABEL, designed to translate between different single-cell multiomic profiles, including RNA, chromatin, and proteins. This aligns with the goal of deriving or predicting RNA expression from other types of cellular data.

2. **Single-Cell Resolution**: BABEL works at the single-cell level, which is crucial for the specific interpolation of RNA expression from protein measurements at this fine resolution.

3. **Including Proteins**: Importently, the abstract mentions that BABEL can incorporate single-cell data modalities such as protein epitope profiling. This specifically indicates that the algorithm can work with protein data, which is a key requirement for interpolating RNA expressions from cell surface protein measurements.

4. **Generalizability and Application**: BABEL has demonstrated generalization to new contexts and cell types, implying robustness in its predictions and potential applicability to various biological datasets not seen during training, including potentially those involving protein measurements influencing RNA expression.

5. **Computational Synthesis**: The algorithm's ability to computationally synthesize multiomic measurements when only one modality is available suggests that if only protein data are available, BABEL may be capable of predicting corresponding RNA profiles.

Thus, this paper could be highly relevant to any research project aimed at understanding or predicting RNA expressions based on measurements of cell surface proteins in single cells, using a computational, data-driven approach.
