Based on the title and abstract of the paper titled "CITE-Viz: Replicating the Interactive Flow Cytometry Workflow in CITE-Seq," it seems that this paper is indeed pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. 

Key points supporting this relevance are:

1. **Multi-omic single-cell sequencing**: CITE-Seq, as described, profiles both the RNA transcriptome and surface protein expression at a single-cell level. This directly relates to the goal of understanding how RNA expression levels can be inferred or linked to surface protein measurements.

2. **Surface protein measurements for clustering**: The abstract mentions that the extra dimension of surface protein markers is utilized for further identifying cell clusters. This suggests that the study involves correlating cell surface markers with the cellular transcriptomic profiles, which is a fundamental step in interpolating RNA expression based on protein measurements.

3. **CITE-Viz visualization platform**: The development of this platform, which includes features for assessing multi-omic co-expression plots and classifying cell clusters by cell surface markers, would be incredibly useful for visualizing and analyzing the relationships between RNA sequences and protein expression.

Therefore, the focus on integrating and visualizing data from both transcriptomic and protein expressions makes this paper highly relevant for research on interpolating RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements.
