The paper titled "COVID-19db linkage maps of cell surface proteins and transcription factors in immune cells" and its abstract indicate a strong relevance to the research goal of interpolating single-cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. The paper employs the SPaRTAN methodology, a computational approach designed to link single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic data, to explore connections between cell surface proteins and transcription factors in immune cells. Such an approach directly aligns with the goal of understanding and modeling how surface protein measurements can infer RNA expression patterns.

Key elements from the abstract that support this include:
1. **Integration of Single-cell Proteomic and Transcriptomic Data**: The text mentions the use of SPaRTAN which integrates these datasets using CITE-seq. This technique is directly pertinent to the objective of correlating protein measurements with gene expression levels, thereby facilitating RNA expression interpolation from surface protein data.
  
2. **Application to COVID-19 Data**: Application of this methodology to COVID-19 CITE-seq datasets to identify associations between surface proteins and transcription factors specifically in immune cells suggests the paper provides case-specific insights that could be extrapolated to other scenarios or enhanced for broader applications in computational biology concerning transcription and translation processes.

3. **Data and Toolset Availability**: The creation of COVID-19db and the associated toolset for analyzing and visualizing these correlations further emphasize the paperâ€™s utility in practical, applied research settings, making it a useful contribution to the field of computational biology research in the context of single-cell data analysis.

In summary, this paper appears highly pertinent to the specified goal as it discusses methodologies and results that directly involve the interpolation of RNA expressions from cell surface protein measurements, particularly within the context of immune cell behavior during COVID-19 infection.
