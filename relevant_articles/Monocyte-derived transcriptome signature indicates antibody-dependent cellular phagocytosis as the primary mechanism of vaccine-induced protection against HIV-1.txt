The paper you've described, titled "Monocyte-derived transcriptome signature indicates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis as the primary mechanism of vaccine-induced protection against HIV-1," primarily focuses on identifying a gene signature associated with vaccine efficacy in the context of HIV vaccine trials. The abstract indicates several significant points pertinent to your research interest concerning interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements:

1. **CITE-seq Profiling**: The paper mentions the use of CITE-seq for profiling 53 surface markers and transcriptomes of 53,777 single cells from a clinical trial. CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing) combines single-cell RNA sequencing and antibody-derived tags to simultaneously detect RNA expression and protein levels from the same cell. This aligns well with your research interest, as CITE-seq directly integrates information on cell surface protein measurements with RNA expression data at the single-cell level.

2. **Target Cell Types - Myeloid Lineage Including Monocytes**: The specific cells where the gene signature is expressed are identified as belonging to the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes. This detail is relevant because it narrows down the target cell types for which RNA expression data might be interpolated based on cell surface protein measurements.

3. **Link to Functional Mechanism**: The identification of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) as a mechanism of vaccine protection underscores the functional relevance of the expressed genes and may provide insights into how protein expressions on the cell surface are linked to RNA expression patterns within specific cellular contexts.

4. **Correlation with Vaccine Efficacy**: The ability to correlate gene expression signatures with observable clinical outcomes (like vaccine efficacy) suggests that similar methodological approaches could be adapted for your research in understanding and predicting RNA expression profiles based on surface protein data.

Therefore, based on the paper's content as described in the abstract, it is pertinent to your research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. The methodologies described within, particularly the application of CITE-seq, would likely provide valuable insights and technical guidance for your project.
