Based on the title and abstract provided, the paper focuses on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and highly multiplexed protein epitope analysis in breast cancer samples to identify novel lymphocyte phenotypes within the tumor microenvironment. The study reveals distinct protein markers for different types of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and explores the association of these markers with disease outcomes and response to immunotherapy.

For the specific research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements, this paper appears to be highly relevant. The use of both scRNA-Seq and protein data suggests the authors are correlating molecular profiles at RNA and protein levels, which aligns with the notion of using protein measurements to infer RNA expression patterns. The identification of novel protein markers for specific immune cell states, if these markers include surface proteins, could be used directly or developed further for interpolating scRNA expression data.

While the paper seems to focus more on the characterization of immune cell phenotypes rather than direct RNA-to-protein interpolation methodologies, the compiled dataset and findings might offer valuable insights or groundwork that could be applied towards modeling RNA expression based on cell surface protein measurements in future studies.
