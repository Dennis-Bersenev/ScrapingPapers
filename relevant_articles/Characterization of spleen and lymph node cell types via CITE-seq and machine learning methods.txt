The provided research paper titled "Characterization of spleen and lymph node cell types via CITE-seq and machine learning methods" appears to be highly relevant to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. Here’s a breakdown of why this paper is pertinent:

1. **CITE-seq Technology**: The study uses CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing), which is a method that allows for simultaneous measurement of surface protein levels and RNA expression within single cells. This is directly related to the goal of linking cell surface protein measurements to RNA expression.

2. **Machine Learning Analysis**: The paper leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze the cellular data obtained via CITE-seq. This kind of analysis is essential for developing models that could interpolate or predict RNA expression profiles based on surface protein data.

3. **Feature Selection and Classification**: The methodologies used, such as mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) and IFS (incremental feature selection), are crucial for identifying key features (which could include specific surface proteins) that correlate strongly with RNA expression patterns. This directly feeds into the goal of understanding how protein measurements can predict RNA profiles.

4. **Practical Application to Immune Cell Types**: Given that the paper focuses on spleen and lymph node cell types—critical components of the immune system—the findings could help in understanding how cell surface markers relate to gene expression in these immune cells, which is a subset of the broader goal.

5. **Identification of Important Markers**: The paper identifies specific proteins and genes like CD4, TCRb, CD103, CD43, CD23, Nkg7, and Thy1 that are linked with cell type identification. Knowledge about such markers could be crucial for developing models to interpolate RNA expression from protein measurements.

In summary, the techniques and data used in this study align well with the objectives of modeling RNA expression based on cell surface protein levels, making it a relevant resource for furthering research in this area.
