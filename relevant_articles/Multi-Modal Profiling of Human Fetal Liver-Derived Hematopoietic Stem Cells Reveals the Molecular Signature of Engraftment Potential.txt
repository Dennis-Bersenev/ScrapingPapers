The research paper titled "Multi-Modal Profiling of Human Fetal Liver-Derived Hematopoetic Stem Cells Reveals the Molecular Signature of Engraftment Potential" appears pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell 
RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. Although the primary focus is not directly specified as such, the abstract indicates the integration of both transcriptional
 data (RNA expression) and protein level data (cell surface markers) in the profiling of fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (FL HSCs).

The abstract mentions that they have profiled thousands of FL cells at both transcriptional and protein levels and integrated these data types. This integration likely involved some form of interpolation or mapping between RNA expression data and protein expression, precisely aligning with the research goal of studying relationships between RNA expression and cell surface protein measurements. This is bolstered by the mention of a "generalizable signature" that includes both transcript and linked cell surface marker expression, indicating a model or analytical methodology that could potentially be leveraged for interpolating RNA expression from protein measurements.

Thus, the methodologies, data types, and analysis strategies described in the abstract suggest that this paper may contain relevant insights, methods, or data that could be utilized in research focused on connecting RNA and protein expression data, particularly in the context of cell surface markers and their associated RNA profiles.
