The paper titled "scMMT: a multi-use deep learning approach for cell annotation, protein prediction and embedding in single-cell RNA-seq data" does appear pertinent to the research goal of interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Relevance to RNA expression and protein measurements**: The abstract specifies that the scMMT model developed in the study incorporates protein prediction tasks alongside cell type annotation. This suggests that the model is designed to correlate and predict protein levels from single-cell RNA sequencing data.

2. **Multi-task Learning Framework**: The multi-task learning approach used in scMMT, including the protein prediction and cell type annotation, indicates that the model is designed to handle both RNA and protein data simultaneously. This capability is integral for studies aiming to interpolate RNA expression based on protein measurement inputs.

3. **Technical Approach**: The model uses advanced techniques such as a novel feature extraction method, logarithmic weighting, and mutual reinforcement between different tasks (e.g., between protein prediction and cell type annotation). These techniques could potentially enhance the model's accuracy in predicting RNA expression from protein measurements.

4. **Performance and Evaluation**: The model has been evaluated on multiple public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various aspects including protein expression prediction. This highlights its effectiveness and applicability in scenarios where RNA expression needs to be inferred from protein levels.

Thus, this paper would be relevant and potentially valuable for research focused on interpolating single cell RNA expression from cell surface protein measurements, as it addresses both cell type annotation and protein prediction using a deep learning framework tailored to these purposes.
